["   all right boys welcome to a  big full stem podcast episode we just flew all the way to croatia we  hopped on a plane we're in croatia we got andrew tate right here lighting up a cigar guy loves guards that's a good sign that's good you ready for this pod you get for the pod let's go already do you have extra guards or what are these what are these hey what the  is this boys are we good or can we could have the cigars come in mid show right andrew or you want to start with the guard we can do i just want to make sure she doesn't  it up who's going who's duty is that yeah who's on who's on cigar duty right now the chick tash you're supposed to be getting them is that your girl or assistant it's a chick one of my chicks yeah one of them one of my wives i got four wives i'm from ethiopia that's one of your wives for real is that a girlfriend girlfriend in a minute so wait when you when you bring a girl when you bring like a girl is she a girlfriend or just a girl for the trip girlfriend girlfriend yeah so you like make her you put her on cigar duty well if i if i need a cigar then i would ask her to go politely get me a cigar yeah what if she said no how could she possibly say no to me what if she's like why why do i have to get your cigars like get your own cigars why do i have to put you on a private jet to  croatia  off then there you go there you go how many how many girlfriends me yeah man i'm a man of god i'm a good man i don't want to be in this podcast i'm trying to tell the world i'm some kind of horrible evil misogynist everyone seems to think i am for some reason i think it's great to have multiple do you yeah why not i mean if they're okay with it yeah well uh do you like a ranking system like you have a main piece and then side girls how does that work i'm a man of god i read the bible i go to church i don't know i can't possibly answer these questions this is obviously going to be watched by every single female that has any kind of association to me and i'm loyal to all of them that's awesome there you go so do do the math on that one see baby i told you i was loyal don't worry about it so to all of you at the same time do you think it's possible for a man to to be loyal to one girl i think it's possible for men to do lots of things sure we go to the moon you belong to one girl and go scuba diving if you want to i don't think that if men were truly honest with themselves that they want to be i think men are loyal to a woman to try and inspire loyalty out of her a man will sit there and go i only want to be with her but really what they're saying is i only want her to be with me which is a masculine imperative and it's natural and i completely understand that every man is the same but if you could make a woman be loyal to you while not being loyal to her then you would not be loyal to her if a man's truly honest and says if i can press this button and she's loyal to me no matter what i do am i still going to only be with her now you might prefer her you might spend 99 of your time with her et cetera completely get that but on a long enough time frame for the rest of your human life if she's going to be loyal to you regardless are you telling me that with a without any kind of backlash from her without the chance of her cheating without any  you're going to tell me for the next 50 years you're not going to  anything ever once if she let you why not like you know what i mean yeah i mean i feel like everyone would agree to that right so it's different for men and women it's completed for men and women and it's also different because a lot of people misunderstand what i say it's different for men of a certain status right if you if you're a man who has this  together at a certain level of status you can say to a woman look i love you with all my heart i want to be with you i'm going to take care of you but you're not going to tell me what to do i'm in charge because this is my life you're on the tape train and we're headed to success station i'm the one driving it and if you're going to be on my train certain things are going to happen if you're unhappy you can get off no problem i feel like you've been experiencing that it's like a high value male me and saleem kind of just started i'm hoping steiny gets there one day but once you get there it'll be funny yeah it'll be dope when you get into the high value area it's like it's pretty fire well if you're hard to replace then you're gonna accept more things than you would except for someone who's easy to replace right this is basic human psychology we can take it away from dating and apply it to basically anything you'll accept your lamborghini breaking down because it's hard to replace it you will not accept your toyota breaking down because you can just go get nissan so it's the same kind of game right if you look at a guy and go he is amazing at everything i truly feel i feel happy with this man i can't find another man on his level who could possibly replace him or fill the hole in my life he would leave sometimes he  that  oh fine you're more like an accepted that's human nature right it's not even about intersexual dynamics and all the things i talk about even though i could use those examples to apply all of my beautiful completely correct logical you know affirmations the reason i don't do that is because everyone comes back because misogynist misogynist misogynist so fine cool stop them all crying let's talk about human nature people are not going to be quick to replace something or attempt to replace something which is basically irreplaceable so if you're a high enough status individual then you get to get away with more that's basic human psychology isn't it as a whole and i think that uh i'm with guys here i'm not i don't have to be pulled out to say i think i can say i know i know i don't think there's any girls in the room is there his you sir is i know that women as a whole are quite understanding of their status women are very very intelligent i know what people say i'm misogynistic and people say i say bad things about women women are very very intelligent in certain key areas and one of the things they are most intelligent at or best at is is reading their own status and understanding what they can and can't get away with women are experts at that you get the same chick who will act xway with one guy and get with a new guy and act completely differently because do you think that subconsciously though i think it's subconscious but i also think they spend a lot of time on instagram a lot of time looking at the competition a lot of time looking in the mirror a lot of time trying to look good a lot of time they spend a lot of time on themselves and within themselves and they're pretty good at understanding their value and what they can get away with when it's compared against the value that's sitting opposite them right so they'll say opposite one guy and be a  and say opposite the next guy and be a sweetheart they're quite smart at that right so it's true so i think that most women actually they get with a guy who they really know has his  together they're not going to sit there with that guy and say listen you better not that cause i'm like if i talk to him that way he's definitely going to do it yeah so they're going to come at a different angle it would really hurt me if you and then once they say it would really hurt me if you then you can then you can apply counters to that in different ways you can just simply ask why would that hurt you well if you're  all these  how do i know i'm special so the only reason you know you're special is because i'm sexually exclusive so if you knew you were special with something else perhaps you did something else with me or i did something else with you that i don't do with anybody else and you know you were special so what you worried about me  that  for and it can't be that logical because females are not that logical you can't explain it that way but i'm saying if you're with a woman long enough and you have frame and you have influence over her and you understand these basic paradigms and you you mention them in the correct conversations at the correct way in the correct frame over time they'll learn to accept it i say this and people completely have a meltdown i don't know why people have a meltdown it's  it's facts it's facts you think any of these dudes  do you think any of these rappers  all these girls the girls are telling them you better be loyal you better be loyal  no because they because of the status because they don't want to be left because they know he'll just say no bye so they just don't they're like okay look at me in the mirror can i be replaced yes can he be replaced not easily  i gotta take this deal that's the game they say and that's human psychology you can apply that to anything about the fight game there's an aside b side human internet human relationships there's an a side b side business deals there's an a side b side someone's got to  take the b side by the way or someone's kind of lose yeah yeah to a degree to a degree and but this is the thing about relationships because we can talk about relationships as a whole everyone says what i say is crazy all i say is that love is real men and women should be in love a man can be completely in love with a woman and care about her and still sometimes  something else like the higher your status the more you can get away with because that girl's so afraid to lose that so you can do whatever you want bro it's the same but it's the same with anything yeah is it like buy a mclaren it's going it's not going to work for half the year they're  nightmares but they're mclarens it's just a game like i used to talk to saleem and he'd have random girls and he'd be like yo i i'm crazy over this chicken i would say saleem dude think about who you are you can get any girl you want these are just random chicks right now it's multiple now it's great so there's levels to it and i think that i think that chicks don't realize that until they don't have it and then they chase back right well women are also addicted to drama this is something else you have to understand about females that's very true females are addicted to drama they are entertained by drama what does a woman do in her spare time she watches the kardashians drama listen up i i i don't want to insult anyone i was about to say a  yeah i'm sick with that a  will sit there a  will sit there and think i need to relax let me watch a murder documentary about a serial killer who chokes people's heads off so i have a nice good night's sleep in bed they're addicted to this  they love drama so to some degree even as a man this is actually an important frame for men to understand to some degree as a man you have to instill drama in the relationship because if you don't she's going to get bored no that's very true and she's either going to leave or she will instill the drama which gives her control you don't want her to bring the drugs girls like to fight they like drama they like to be entertained so if she instills the drama it's probably gonna involve some other  dude you don't want that  right so you have to instill drama so this is the question i always say to all the people who say i'm misogynistic and my view on relationships are wrong etc etc i say look i have beautiful women who are loved with me and we're all happy and smiling every day i get to  whatever i want i have a very positive relationship with females my life's good you disagree with everything i say but your relationship you and your woman don't even  so like if you take the other paradigm 99 of men disagree with me but they go they marry one chick they be the good guy get married sit with her or just her i'm loyal but they're all getting  divorced the chicks giving them a hard time you never see that dude who did the right thing and then go i can do whatever the  i want because i do the right thing so you know what leave her at home i'm hitting the club and do what i want cause i don't cheat never it's like ah she's gonna get mad and he's the good guy i'm the bad guy and i get to say see you next week so what is that what is the cheating code in andrew tate's like books like how do you morally cheat if you have a girl you're honest with her you're up front with her it's not even about that because when i say it on these podcasts i have to condense everything i have to be very compenduous and have to try and or how does one not entertain how does one morally it's just about understanding and instilling a mental frame inside of the female that makes her understand that it's really not that big a deal that coupled with your status and the fact that you're hard to replace will make you be able to get away with it and when i say get away with i don't even mean get away with it it can be very honest an open thing i'm telling you man like you'd be most men would be surprised by how deviant women are if you have a woman and you're truly cool and you're truly together and she truly loves you you come home have you been out there you  that  i did  that  you know what i  her but her tits are not as good as yours come here she doesn't give a  what if she had a better rack though well then she's in trouble right but i'm saying if the framing is right but it's about the mental framing i say these things and men think i'm full of  you have to understand the mental framing i'll give an example if a man says that's your line when you come home and you just dog just but i'm talking about the mental framing if a woman gets with a man and his frame is correct that woman over a long enough period of time has the same political views likes the same music likes the same movies has the same friends as him watches the same things on youtube the same netflix shows do you see a woman who loves that man doesn't she do everything the man does so that man truly believes it can explain to her in a sensible way look i love you i take care of you i pay your  rent you're living with me that   that  who cares i  her so what who gives a  she ain't here she lives in the  penthouse shut up eventually she's gonna be like okay well as long as those girls don't live with you they absorb their man's frame that's the frame hold on though so what if what if your girl comes home same scenario and goes uh yo your dick is bigger that's not gonna make you happy though bro okay so this this argument is one i've heard so many trillion times they say well if you can do that why can't the woman do that and i can answer it in so many different ways give your harshest way i yeah my harshest way is that it goes against the will of god in nature it goes against the way of man for the longest period of human history men had more than one woman every king every sultan read the bible read the quran in most of the world today men still have more than one woman never in history in any book ever in any civilization since the dawn of human time have promiscuous women been celebrated ever they have been frowned upon in every single society ever the main reason is because of paternity because what happens is if i have five girlfriends and they all get pregnant we know who the five mothers are in town thank you and we know who the five fathers are yeah well the father the father for the five kids so you know who the kids belong to yeah if you have a woman who's sleeping with five dudes once she gets pregnant nobody knows who the  kid belongs to now the dna test might be able to fix that modern science right but there's a whole bunch of modern science has to work the devil that shit's new humans evolutionarily grew up until the 1950s 1960s where none of that  was doable you had to know who the mother and the father was you had to have a virgin that's what that's why they celebrate virginity in most these places on the planet they can't do a four dna test if she a virgin i don't know as a fact i'm not i'm the father so i gotta  deal with her  that's why virginia is so important most of the world to this day so to come along and say a woman can do it too it's disgusting in the eyes of god in the eyes of nature you can come along with science and somehow then try and fix it and prove it so that's so god god just wants the boys to just run through change god wants the warriors god's looking down right now and he's like boys i just want you to run through chicks god is that god wants us to god wants the the men the masculine males of earth to reproduce create his warriors god needs warriors what parable is that in it's take take 15 i'll search it up look it up god needs warriors new testament new and old i'm everywhere bro i'm around i'm around read the book g i'm in there somewhere you'll see it you know that sounds like okay he probably wrote that one luke nah that wasn't luke that was tate that one how about but what about what about have you ever dated a girl that makes more money than you that's impossible it's possible what do you mean what if what if you what if like what if you when you finally go to the us you're in la and kylie jenner pulls up on you and she's like she's still not returning me she's richer than you yeah she is i'm but i'm rich in ways beyond money you're thinking no i'm talking financially then i guess i'm gonna i'm gonna have a very good life all right would you ever date a girl that's richer than you  yes why not i so then would you let her pay bills i spent most of my life dating dating girls who were richard miller for a long time i had no money and i dated  she might have more money in me there was no problem for me because i was still in control i'm still in charge masculine framework maximum frame is not all about money the idea that it's all money is not true at all right i did very very well in my life when i had no money and also i was a professional fighter and i was on the way up and i was fighting i didn't really have that much money i did fine so what if there are there are dudes in new york right now selling cds on the street with like four girlfriends and they're just tearing through  everyone knows this life on the slide they're doing fine so are they just about but then what leverage do you have over them if you're not taking care of them like what if kylie jenner's like what the  like you're on my jet it's bigger than yours like you can't  cheat on girls now if i'm if i'm or would you just dip at that point if i'm on that jet it's my jet it's your job if i'm on her jet then it becomes my jet what if it says kylie's skin on the outside because if she's my chick do you make her pull off the decal no no i shouldn't keep it but if she's my chick then you know she's mine so her things are now mine to my jet my house this is my jet young lady sit down be quiet it's gonna be fine don't worry about it i  hannah montana whoever it's gonna be okay like so there might be some celeb beef there but it's not just about money i want people to understand it's not just about money because i have money is not the reason i say these things frame in and of itself is not just about cash but do you think you could pull that off with the boss  that's what i'm saying well then well this is interesting right so now we can apply this to the things like that that'd be a true test that we can apply this to things i've been saying someone like kylie jenner is far more difficult to replace because she's more scarce right so then again then she would be able to turn around and try and play the same game back with me i'm not saying that it's all a game and it's all just a chess match and those kind of things i'm saying these are the basics of human dynamics in human nature and that someone like kylie jenner can have anyone on the planet there's only one of her i i want to actually say something quickly before i go into this i am i'm new new to being big on the internet i really don't know what kylie jenner looks like wait is kylie jenner yeah that's cat that's a huge cat who's the guy you just brought up keeping up with the kardashians yeah but who's the dude one caitlyn caitlin oh okay  that girl i thought you're just setting me up that's the hardest i thought you were setting me up saying i'm talking about dude all right okay okay kylie's like slightly less hot than caitlyn okay yeah okay so uh yeah obviously it'd be a slightly different dynamic but i'm not saying that but who who is she dating now travis scott okay is he loyal i don't know i think he dogs probably not he probably dogs what do you think do you know travis scott i don't know i don't know these people so i don't know these people but what i'm saying is that at a certain level of masculine frame i think most women are kind of like don't tell me about it i don't want to know about it just do your thing please love me i love you back boom and most will agree with this i say this to girls all the time because i say these things and girls say my man would never cheat my man doesn't cheat blah blah blah i say go into there into his room and demand to see his phone and no matter what excuse he gives you don't buy it demand to see it why do you want that though why would you do your boys like that no because exactly why'd you do your voice cause what's on the phone huh what's on his phone probably some  that some  some  yeah so every man's do it anyway so every woman knows it and the reason she doesn't demand to see his phone because she'll want every illusion do you think that that's fair for her to want to see the phone and get to see it  no i try to  off but i'm just saying that women know truthfully because they truly want to find out they could and they don't want to find out they want to just pretend can we can we can can i ask you something about the um the body count thing about having chicks have their body counts on their foreheads no you have to explain it first explain it for the professional i will be a professional we're on one of the biggest podcasts in the world so please explain he's new to the world he's new to the pod too but no i'm not explaining to the pokemon wow yeah probably with this guy yeah um you said you had to have a girl said have lines for each body that they've had was on their face no you said it would if girls would have the number of body count or whatever they have on their head it'd make everything way easier how so how would it be displayed i don't know exactly what you said after that but i know i'm here on this podcast you guys you don't even understand why i said i'm i'm i'm upset because we want we want the audience to know so we need you to dive into it i said that a lot of the world's problems could be fixed if women walked around with their body pants on their foreheads i didn't say lines sorry what would be fixed like world hunger everything will be fixed bro society at large could benefit from that scenario what does that fix because you have to extrapolate it you have to extrapolate it and look at the point if women can't just sleep with anybody and everybody because they're going to be known for it and shamed for it they're going to be very very selective with who they sleep with if they're very very selective then men are going to have to be very very they're going to be very very hard working and very very dedicated to becoming a man worth sleeping with so now men are going to be more honorable men are going to try harder men are going to be more interested in making sure that they're a person who's upstanding in society women are going to be very selective who they choose they're more likely to stick with a guy through thick and things they don't add a new number to their head families will return families are an extension family is an extension of society as a whole right it's family then it's town then it's city that's pretty state that makes somewhat sense they should make a black mirror episode about that sure they should try it i disagree of course you disagree i'll tell you why tell me why because it's different like if you're looking for a onenight stand and one chick has three bodies and one chick has 50 the chick with 50 is going to give you a way freakier night than the chick with three so i'd maybe go with a girl with 50 you're gonna walk around looking for chicks thinking i want one that smells like a onenight stand though i want one who's been plowed who's going to give you a free here yeah yeah i wouldn't want that i don't think anything for a onenight stand okay two bodies two bodies yeah you  you give me one night yes there's a lot more like  behind the scenes that you guys play on has anyone ever heard that i would never you don't understand the logic girl had 100 bodies or 200 okay so if she has one if she has one and then another chick has 10 who would you rather watch one one all day what's wrong with you you guys just don't get freaky i guess obviously well i mean it's not about freaky i mean if you want chicks you smell a dick that's your thing but that ain't my thing i don't think it's most men's thing man is a wild take men are interested in men men are interested in innocence it's innocence that men find appealing that's what most people understand women don't even know what men find attractive what actually amazes me is that women go through the world they're so concerned with how they look they have no understanding on a basic level of what men find attractive in women and i know that for a fact because every single time i sit with a chick and talk to her especially for the first time or on a date or something she's saying always completely the wrong thing she's saying exactly which makes me less attracted to her the fact she's still hot will get her through it what's the worst thing a woman can say on a first date the worst thing is it's just basic things they don't think about right what's the worst thing they could say on the phone i think there's a bunch of dumb  they could say but within a realistic within a realistic frame i i don't know but it's all bad i'll tell you why it's all bad women will sit there and do something they think is innocent they'll talk about traveling i've been to here and i've been to there and i loved what i saw this my favorite place is this that when you sit with a dude on a first date and tell him how many places you've been all he's thinking is you've been you've been  yeah you've been  by who who paid for that yeah nice hotel  like it's  like you shut the  up and on top of it men want men want innocence and the reason we find innocence attractive is because we want to be the females portal to the world if i meet a woman you want to hear they've never been anywhere never i will show you the world 100 first private jet you get on will be mine you've ever been a lambo no you're getting my one first i'm gonna show you brand new experiences if i sit there with some  she's like i've been there i've been that i went to this party my friend has a jet i was in this lambo and you're just like shut the  up there's nothing less attractive because we want to be their portal to the world the reason women don't understand this is they sometimes think especially if they're sitting with a g like they sit with a guy like me they feel like they have to prove themselves by pretending they've been with other ballers right they don't want to sit there with a man like me and go oh i've never been into a restaurant like this i wish they would say that that's the most  attractive thing they could say to me but instead they'll say yeah i've been here that uh my friend uh and i did this they dropped dubai and then it's over they start dropping about  other  that they did with them they say dude you gotta get the check right away yeah it's just like shut up shut up but they don't so women don't even know what men find attractive because we're interested in innocence so he's talking about body counts it's not even just about the freaky data i'm interested if i have an experience with a woman whether it's sexual or nonsexual i want to be her portal to the world i want to be the person who shows her something for the first time i don't want to  a  she's been  every way she can be  like why is it something new now backflips maybe he's doing backflip i don't know but it's to me that's all you're missing the point that is true that is true i think uh girls do think it is symmetrical that like oh man girls girls like the same thing girls and you know you know what's worse about chicks on dates i've been talking about chips on dates for a long time i don't know if i'm allowed to smoke or not but i don't really listen who gives a  all right good you guys want us shout out to y'all for letting us uh smoke in this hotel yeah here pass them around thank you for getting us this smoking permit no this is good where that i can talk about chicks on dates for a long time cause they're  the worst date you've ever been on they're  awful well can you give us a strategy the worst thing we need to cut them and  you gotta cut her i got a cutter's just there can you give us a strategy on how to have something first first we complain about all the things women do so first they talk about traveling which they need to not do because men don't want to hear that another thing women do you know what another thing men hate is for all the chicks watching this you know another thing men hate we hate those uh social  you know what i'm saying you meet a girl for the first time right first time go on here's a test when you meet a  for the first time so what are you doing next week correct answer oh nothing just home attractive that's what i want to hear you ain't been nowhere you don't go nowhere just home what are you doing next week oh well my friend has uh our exhibition and then my my girl knows this guy who's doing this thing and we're going to this party this launch for this new clothing line and then on wednesday it's my friend's birthday her name's chloe she's so funny and we're gonna go here and then this that it starts giving you this busy schedule ho slot shut up unattractive don't wanna hear it you're a hoe you've been too many places you're not home enough you're not reading the bible uninterested busy  social  unattractive next thing that's unattractive that women do is when they  say do you think all social  are  though what if they're out there just grinding it's about that men don't want that i'm talking about pure just attraction she could be an innocent angel doing all these things the fact that still she's going to sit there with me and start talking about all these places she goes i don't want to hear that i want to hear innocence purity sit at home don't i don't like when they're  but i kind of find it hot when they have their own  going you ever own  going from home probably whatever it is as long as they're not  okay no but the problem is you're saying they're not  right if a woman's going to all these different places and she's attractive lots of guys are at least trying to  her but not if she's with a top g okay that's right but she's not with you yet issues date one if she is yeah okay so it's date one right it's date one so for the last x amount of months she's been running all over xyz me and xyz and you have to look at her and have enough faith that nobody's ever managed to put their dick in or ever and the truth is it really ain't that hard so it's like a social  is the worst i i walked in a restaurant with a girl and she was and she was like oh and then we're waiting in this little line there's like two people in front of us like literally one couple in front of us the line would have been maybe six seconds it wasn't even worth kicking off oh i know the manager what did it and i looked and go how do you know the manager oh i just know him through that uh i was like i just wanted to leave like now i'm just like now you know the manager of the best restaurant in the city you're a  now i gotta sit there you're hoe now how many times have you been here with who who have you  been here with it's offputting it's disgusting i see what you're saying because like a lot of the times when men deal with women i mean it is sexual you know what i mean so like when she obviously you're probably thinking oh you know the manager  are you  over you  him or you've been here on how many dates with who or you and your girls are here drinking oh the manager the manager the manager wants to  you that's a fact that's it um yeah where's my lighter you stole my lighter he's lighting it has like a girl ever brought you back to meet her parents and if she does do you do you act this way like you be real parents love me you act this way though too i love you parents love them how to like it do you tell the dad like i'll never stay loyal to your daughter nah but i say i say something else i say look look she's been out too much save that like for dessert maybe when that comes right finally she's under control but don't don't worry she was living haram but i'm here now she's gonna live a good life now i'm glad i met her before it was too late i'm going to save your daughter yo i'm here to save her life that's probably like you moms might not well they all love me you're lowkey a lover boy inside i feel like no i believe no i believe in loving that i'm just yeah you're a big cuddler you like cuddles yeah completely i'm a nice guy but all i'm talking about is just the things women do on dates that are unattractive and i'm just saying that women do so much shit's unattractive and usually it's 99 the time they're talking they're just saying unattractive  talking about where they been and this goes back to the meta point that we want to be their portal to the world we want innocence it's what men are biologically attracted to so if any woman out here is watching it flick roll it sideways roll it's a dupont roll it sideways dupont it's saleem  is this sideways bro from the middle of the light or roll it sideways down no lower lower lower in the middle of the lighter that's it so i'm telling this for all the chicks who watch the podcast let's say you're on a date with a guy and you really want to get him you ain't been nowhere you ain't done  you're an undiscovered diamond i don't know i've never been to a place like that oh how do i open the car door i don't know how lambo car doors work oh i've never done this i've never been there i've never been on holiday that's that's what a man wants to hear he does not want to hear the story oh yeah i went there once and me and my friends all four of us went there because it was her party and it did shut the  up it's unattractive wait how do you and women don't know this women don't know this because they'll say all this  and the man will still bang them so they think they did good on the date i begged me well no he was gonna bang you anyway no matter what you said but if you want to love you you'd learn to shut the  up this is true because men are fine innocent attractive except for him you think it's harder i'd agree with men find innocence attractive that's yeah but do you think i didn't even actually realize that until you said it would you when you want a date with chick would you rather hear her say i've never been to the club ever or i go to the club every weekend obviously never been to the club it's harder to find hot girls in that situation oh it's certainly harder to find innocent hot girls because hot girls are absolutely not really corrupted because they're corrupt because they're an asset that men try and corrupt men try and find hot chicks and show them the world yeah so you have to be there first right it's not easy to do i'm not saying that it's easy i'm saying you get there first though it's how'd you get the first gun pg about it there are the odd ones you can't find the old one who's a bit older who hasn't had too much experience in life or sat around some dork for a while or whatever but in general this is also one of the reasons men find youth attractive you want to blow up the internet i'll pull up the internet right  now the reason 18 and 19 year olds are more attractive than 25 year olds is because they've been through less dig i'll say this right here on the  internet i don't give a  people will sit there and go you can't say that yes i can a 19 year old is more attractive than a 26 year old woman and i'll tell you why because that 26 year old has talked to more guys been to the club more times been more places been  and dumped more times more arguments more heartbreak more  more mess for me to clean up whereas a 19 year old might have had one guy from high school just broke up she's fresh and i could  put my imprint on her make her a good person and without her having to go through all that detriment to learn about life so what's your key age range 19 it's not it's not just about the adrenaline it's the example no i know but what's your what's your what's your preference i mean hot girls are hot girls right i don't know hot girls are hot girls but my point is that older women the reason they're less attractive to men even if men don't instinctually understand it it's because they've been through a whole bunch more  and and we're not interested in dealing with someone else's problems if you get with a girl who's 26 27 she's gonna be sitting there going i know men like you i've seen what men like you do you ain't going out i don't like that i ain't dealing you're telling me wait wait you're telling me you were innocent and sweet for this dude you were nice to him he  you and messed you up and now i deal with the attitude problem you've developed because he got your  i didn't even want him to  you in the first place you should've been a virgin when you met me now i'm dealing with your  get  goodbye don't you think though the you know trying to find purity out of women it kind of is like a low possibility i mean it's kind of like when a woman says i want a guy that's like six feet tall whatever the case may be right there's less to them and like it's like dude you can't really find a version the best things in the world are low probability it doesn't mean it's not what we desire we're talking about we what we desire and what i'm saying is that one of the best things about status is that you can now get what you desire so at status most men have this dream of sleeping with endless women i could if i decided could sleep with a new woman every single day for the next 10 years all i would have to do is reply to my instagram inbox it would not be difficult i could do it it's not interesting to me i'm more interested in using my status to find something extremely rare like a woman of innocence that's what i'm talking about here i'd rather find one two three four maybe five women of innocence and keep them as opposed to just sleeping with endless women because sex really ain't all that interesting to me i think it gets boring after a while so that's the point we're making yeah it's hard to find but just because it's hard to find doesn't mean it's not what every man intrinsically really wants it's what men really truly want and what's actually interesting about it all is no matter how innocent the female she still wants the man to have had experience if you were to ask a virgin woman do you want a virgin boyfriend she'd say no or if she'd stuck with one man and she'd lived a good life do you want a man to lift a good life and being with one woman um no maybe he should have slept with a few more they want you to have been xyz right so you can you could have been a playboy except with a thousand girls and get with a virgin she wants you to be that way and you want her to be that way it's fine that's how it's supposed to work reason's all  up now you got women out here with some of the hundred dudes sleeping with a guy who  like 15 chicks and he wonders why you can't keep her under control well of course  not i gotta pull that off it's hard for guys it's hard for dudes man cause these chicks are just running through dick it's hard and if they run through enough dick they're eventually going to end up on some  a real a real g's dick we talk about i i get called a lot on the internet one of these red pill guys and it annoys me because i mean oh this whole red pill man's atmosphere what does red pill mean oh something about girls and dating and all this  i'm not one of them but sir a lot some of the things they say is true and the point i'm trying to make is that if if you get a woman who slept with enough dudes eventually some of those dudes are gonna leave an imprint on her you can't fill any i'll be honest with you i feel sorry for any man who's with any of my exes you're going to come along you ain't me i could whoop your ass she knows i can whip your ass you can't give her what i give her you can't do what i can do and now you're sitting there going oh i still love you and and the deepest darkest night she's laying there next to you going you ain't andrew you just tried your very best you just tried your very best and that didn't feel like it when tate did it and that's it so like it's like they're widowed in their mind and you can't truly attach to them because part of them still belongs to someone else this is what happens at true status if i run through 10 chicks i get to know i've ruined 10 wives guaranteed 10 divorces guaranteed because whoever she marries she will not be happy with because she will dream of me for the rest of her  human existence guaranteed that's how it gets you get to that point at a certain status of man how do you get to that point you gotta get your  together how many pushups you've done today none the  day one asks me stupid questions how many have you done bro i could put i'm ready i live ready i do push ups in my sleep how many pushups do you do today i don't really train the gym too often i do like 500 1000 pushups a day whenever whenever i'm if i'm ever on the computer i set myself a little target so if i'm on the computer and i'll i'll set a time or i'll say when this song ends or whatever mentally and then i'll just drop into as many as i can you try to do a 500 to 1000 500 000 a day how many can you bang out in one set 100 150 wow so what else is your like lifting schedule that's it man i just do a bunch of pushups chest pushups bunch of pushups if i'm in the gym i'll train but i live on the road so i don't often get access to a gym you guys don't just go to the gym on like well if i stay in a nice hotel would be gyms but i do lots of like car rallies and  i'm on the car or i'm about to be on a boat for a week and this kind of shit's hard right but you can you can easily find it really good then no not really you eat whatever the  you want i eat basically whatever i want drink a lot smoke a lot damn yeah but if but like a thousand pushups today is enough if you actually just a drop and this is another thing that we can go into another point i'm at a point is that really the key like just doing pushups yeah but you have to live with competitive males this is another point that that's a this is it's kind of related to what i was going to say one of the reasons my life's so fantastic and i'm such a highperforming human being is because i live with other competitive men you are the sum of the five people you spend the most time with if i'm with a group of five men and all of them are dropping doing pushups all the time am i gonna be the only one who doesn't do it that's so funny i'm i'm asking you a question i'm not gonna be the only guy who goes with my arms tired like a  if i'm hung with you for five days and you boys are just ripping pushups you're gonna start doing it all right now if we're doing more than you you're gonna try and you're gonna try and beat us yeah so you're gonna do as many as you can no of course you are you are you're around in every situation that's right so if i'm rolling with people and we're all in constant competition then you're going to stay a competitive male so the reason it's easy for me to do pushups is because i think healthy competition is the key to everything it's the health it's the key to masculinity men for the longest human period of time we're in gangs or armies this is how we've always been so if my brother who's bigger than me drops and starts doing it well i'm gonna sit there and go don't feel like it dude so you have to be competitive this is another thing that actually ties into things we're talking about where it's actually detrimental when women and men live together completely and exclusively women always say this when women get real g they try to attach themselves to you don't live with your boys anymore good that uh live with just me come on let me be a real couple bubba and i understand why they want that because they want to remove you from all the  they're afraid of right the girls to parties to fun they want you to completely rely on them so they have power and control over you but if you live exclusively just with a chick you are not going to be as competitive as a man so it's not smart it's not well it's going to make her happy that's fine but i'm talking about purely emotion out of it logically you're not going to be as competitive as a man as if you live with your boys who are competitive if you're training for a fight you don't live with just your chick you live with a bunch of men trainers it's not on purpose right if you're with your boys and you're all competitive and it doesn't just have to be physical you can be competitive with anything if you live with five millionaires and they're telling you every day how much money they're making you're gonna be really pissed off being broke you're gonna be furious you ain't gonna have it 100 percent if you're living with your chick and you're broke but you know she cooks for you she sucks dick good you watch netflix you can get very very comfortable very very quickly with very very little living with a chick so there's another reason my life is so fantastic is because if i had a woman no matter how perfect she would be about look i live with my brother and my cousin and my team i live with you sometimes yeah i stay with you sometimes but i'm with them because i must compete against them because competing against them means i automatically compete against the world and i automatically win because i'm living with some of the most competitive people on the planet that's how it goes so there's another thing that ties into it right so the whole frame what's actually also very interesting is i need the lighter again if you don't mind my friend the lighter interesting we're talking about status and how women love status but are you gonna be a high status man if you're not competitive no so you'll get a chick you'll fall in love with her you go this is a really good one let me move in with her let me do the right thing you're going to live with her and you're slowly over a matter of time years months whatever going to fall off and now there's other dudes out there who are hungry bro and then you're going to wonder why why everyone's getting divorced i'll tell you why because you moved in with that  you got belly sitting around eating lasagna that's why i will say that's true i mean and like i had a girlfriend once and i felt like i wasn't doing as much but once it was over it was game over i was just going nuts oh croatia all right bro all right boys we had to pause the pod for a sec i'm watching this with you boys right now too this shit's  hilarious we are dropping on full suncom it's live right now high value mail shirts absolutely fire limited limited stock so if you guys want one cop one right now really really quick before they sell out wholesalingcom let's get back in the pot i find that very true the the falling off thing because when you get too comfortable and you feel as if like you're content with life like especially with just another girl it's gonna be it's gonna be hard i mean well women women women want to make your life comfortable a good woman yeah all right bro a good woman will do what she's supposed to do which is make your life comfortable right she'll cook for you chill blah blah blah which is fine that's what she's supposed to do she's a good chick but it's going to make you comfortable it's going to make you lazy you are going to lose your competitive edge i will say that so if you're you're most competitive when you're a man in fact this actually can be translated into larger a bunch of things at large you can translate this to society as a whole you can translate this to basic things like  crime rates gee you look at some of these countries in the world now where crime is getting out of control a lot of is related to the fact that there are there's militaryaged men or young men in gangs who can't get no  because women are just chasing clout and you've got these young men who can't get no  and they get angry and aggressive and they're like what can i do about this i need to matter get rich or die trying so there's like it's it's all related like women are just women or women are required to a certain degree to soften men i understand that and having no women in your life at all will make you dangerous it'll take it too far but you can't go too far the other way and just become  soft yeah what's your thought on uh islam and everything because i know in the quran and stuff like you could have up to four wives and stuff so i've seen you talk about it a little bit but i would like to know like what you think about it i think it's the last religion on the planet it's the right religion i think it's the last religion so if this if it's the last true religion on the planet then it has to be the correct one because i don't think is it the last one it's the last position because no other religion has boundaries which they enforce if you stand if you will tolerate everything then you stand for nothing if your book says x but you refuse to say the book says this i'm sticking to what the book says doesn't matter what the subject is right i don't want to expand i think i think everyone can work it out if you're a christian 99 christians are ignoring every single rule inside the bible okay everybody should interpret the bible you're saying like they like pick and choose what they want to oh yeah they try and say i interpret it differently i believe in god but you know i don't believe in that part that that's not what the book says it doesn't seem to know it doesn't say ignore half of me it says follow me only muslims follow their book no true no true so they're the last religion yeah who gives a  if christians come along and say i'm a christian you know give a  you ignore the bible well isn't there a lot of muslims that don't follow the quran too i'm sure there's i'm sure there's a lot of muslims who don't completely follow the quran but i'm saying that if you were to go out there and try and find muslims who live true to the quran completely you can find them yeah you ain't going to find a city you can find christians no you won't  any religion but like dude you're not going to find a muslim  like that's right like a woman that's a muslim that's a bro you should put me in any  church give me the hottest church there's muslim  out there i'm sure there are but i'm saying he's the point he's making is you can find a bunch of women who adhere to islam who are still virgin to the age of 25 waiting for an enraged marriage oh yeah you will not find that under christianity yeah you could find a couple but you're right there's probably more muslims that follow christians christians there's more devout muslims than devout christians christianity has no power left it's it's a power even the pope is up here talking about and i i want to make this very very clear i'm not i'm not  antianything i'm not homophobic i don't give a  i'm talking about what the book says if the book says man and women lay together and then the pope is going to stand up now and saying that you can be a gay preacher the book doesn't mean anything now so the whole religion doesn't mean anything so the rules don't mean anything if you're tolerant of everything you stand for nothing the problem is with religion is that naturally needs to be intolerant for a religion to be a religion which is respected it needs to be intolerant of certain things you can't say we're a religion which tolerates everything now you have no belief systems but when was that book written you know it does yeah completely but the world evolves completely so christianity has evolved into nothing islam hasn't this is the point i'm making the point i'm making is if you're going to throw your own rules away you can't stand up and say this is a religion these are our doctrines but we tolerate everything and we don't punish anyone for anything and none of it really matters are you a christian well who the  isn't biggest hoe in the world's a christian porn stars are christians who gives this  it doesn't mean anything it's different with islam with islam you can't get away with it even if you're saying that there's some islam  etc etc fine that's cool but people don't stand up and openly disrespect islam oh hell no because they're afraid so once again if you don't have rule systems and doctrines and beliefs and prophets which people are afraid to mock are you even a religion people won't disrespect islam nobody will disrespect it because they're scared even in a christian country what do you want what do you mean by disrespect i mean disrespect it say something disrespect it i you can walk around if you could wear a tshirt saying jesus is gay right here in croatia a christian country and you will make it out of the country alive i dare you to do the same thing with the islamic prophet i dare you to do the same thing you wouldn't make out of a christian country alive an islamic country alive even in christian countries you are not safe to do that you do not disrespect their beliefs yeah disrespecting our lives no you don't do that yeah you don't nobody doesn't so what i'm saying if they're the last religion on earth that people are afraid to disrespect if their god is the last god on earth that people are afraid to disrespect then he's the only god that matters if every other god can be mocked laughed at put in video games and  shot at stupid  dressed up gay on tv shows what kind of  what kind of religion is that it's a joke yo it's a good point man how come you're the like you ever get afraid of getting canceled for being so just the  you say did you just say firstly let's make a few things no and i i know i understand but wait wait let me finish i mean that in the sense where it's like you you seem to say crazy  and your audience gets bigger when usually people who say some  that you say a lot of people would come after them that's true but firstly i don't live in fear so i'm not afraid of anything but how could you get canceled because most of your  is not even your own accounts right secondly i'm just breaking down the sentence as a professional because that's what i do you said fear of getting canceled so the first word incorrect was fear i'm not afraid of anything i don't live in fear second thing is canceled if i was going to be afraid of anything on the planet the last thing i'd be afraid of is getting cancelled like i've had people try to kill me i have real enemies as we stand right now there are groups of men waking up who want a bullet in my head i'm trying i'm not i don't give a  if some dork on the internet makes a video saying cancel tate don't give a solitary  i have real problems so just breaking down the sentence i'm not afraid of  would never be afraid of getting canceled to answer the meta question as to am i worried that someone's gonna hear something i say and then be offended and then people aren't gonna follow me anymore once again i couldn't give a  i don't give a  i say what i think these are the things i truly believe some people agree with me some people don't agree with me and that's absolutely not really fine you're right i am doing very very well despite the fact i'm saying things i'm not supposed to say yeah it's crazy it's crazy i'm doing very very well but i think the reason that is is because people know i'm authentic people know i actually mean them i can explain them in a way that makes them hard to disagree with even feminists struggle to argue with me on a lot of points and also i really do believe the things i say most people intrinsically even if it's a lesser version of even if it's less extreme agree with me most men intrinsically agree with a lot of the things i say i'm surprised no feminists have ever come out like come for your neck no no they've tried but but how can you come for my neck how can you come from my neck when their their basic battle cry and their basic weapons are ineffective first let's call him a misogynist yeah i'm a misogynist okay next you're sexist yeah probably next okay i'm gonna cancel you don't give a  i ain't got nothing to cancel i want everyone else's account i ain't got an account next okay well well we can't call an incell uh you're a misogynist like it's just a circle they don't have any weapons yeah they have no weapons against me how are you gonna sit there to the dude sit with a bunch of beautiful women in his mansion and then say you're you're sexist you're ugly you're a three these chicks are hot and they chose memes i don't even  what you say i'm not interested it's actually very unfortunate it's kind of unfortunate because women are completely and utterly solely judged on how they look like a lot of these feminists are  they're so busted like you if you're gonna be a feminist at least get hot first because if you're hot you'll matter oh the hot  said this you ever think that the ugly  said this oh you hear what ugly  said have you ever heard no one cares nobody cares you're ugly just nobody cares i understand why you're mad i'm me and the hot  with me i get it you're mad at god that's fine but but what do you do cancel me i don't care make a video keep making videos i don't care there's a direct correlation between that right hot girls aren't going to come after you but the ugly ones will well hot girls hot girls love men who are prepared to protect provide take care of them if you're prepared to protect provide and take care to a degree you see yourself in a position of authority to a degree right it's my i need to take care of her i'm going to pay her rent she's going to come on my boat she's going to listen to me she'll have a good life you see yourself in a position of authority which means to some degree you are misogynistic women beautiful women love misogynistic men when you see a 19 year old ukrainian on a billionaire's yaw in dubai is she complaining that he's the boss and he's in charge or she's like oh i'm glad he bought this bow i don't know how boats work i just want to  have a cocktail i'm being misogynist cool you work out the poor fees i don't give a  god damn it so they love misogynist so the only women who don't love misogynists are the women who are too ugly to get  by a misogynist and then they want to come along and try and cancel you on the internet i don't give a  cancel me i will stand up right here and say i am sexist now i don't mean that in a bad way right because i'm sexist both ways i try and say this all the time but no one can seem to fathom it especially not feminists with their miniscule brains there are certain things in the world that i only trust men with and there's certain things in the world that i only trust women with i'm not talking about superiority because superiority is field dependent men are better at certain things one thing you can never let a woman do the top thing a woman would never let her do over a man oh there's loads of things bro loads of things what's the topic i'll tell you the number one thing so anything that is violence related women should be nowhere near so give an example my woman is very well trained that if it goes off in the street she needs to just run and scream if i say  off leave and i'll tell you why i have seen the number of times i've seen a man walking with this chick some beef goes the girl tries to like get in the way she doesn't want her man or the fight to happen get him get hurt i've seen a woman try to get in the way that uh then she turns to her own man gets hold of his arm like don't don't holds his primary weapon when he gets knocked the  out and she's holding on his  right hand boom kale head stomped wow stupid  now her intentions may have been pure but she just  ended her man's life you are not capable and you're not prepared for the physical physical anything altercation like  off don't get in the middle of it don't hold on to me  off don't try and calm it down run and call the police run but there's because i've seen i see it so many times bro especially if a man's outnumbered because the chick might love him she might have truly pure intentions my three dudes on her guy oh leave it leave it she's in the way and  they're just gonna hurt you if they're really about it they're really from the street and they'll knock you out now like with that what the  you there for now now go protect you and me get the  out of here so anything violence related that's why i don't like holding hands with the chick i've seen it happen man you're holding hands to the  down the street you don't hold hands at all if you hold hands with a girl right right you never hold on don't let me catch you in a photo holding hands i really in certain scenarios okay yeah but like if i walk by the beach yeah like it's very lonely sunset but if i'm walking if i'm walking down the street i don't like to hold hands with the chick because if anything were to go off or happen her instinct is to just grasp you and hold you which is fine are you like wanted like that it's not about it's not about whether i'm wanted like that be prepared well to say you don't want to hold hands with a girl because you're worried shit's gonna go down bro there's terrorist attacks there's  there's  that happens guns go off cars start plowing through things i do have enemies whatever whatever i don't want to think  oh get the  off me and then i don't have time i don't have time for it for what hold hands at home we're walking now professionalism we're walking somewhere stand there don't  something goes off leave me to deal with it and and i've seen women in situations where even when their intentions are completely pure they're not just a neutral they are a net negative a woman who does not properly train will get your ass ended she will get your ass put the  asleep so see all the time so that's one thing i don't trust women with i give you a bunch of examples i don't let women drive me in cars everyone loses their mind when i say this i'll drive never never drove your bugatti  what the  who who is this guy that's cat no no woman is hot enough for you ever i can't never let a girl you never let her wait have you there's been a yeah you got a soft spot man come on i wouldn't wait have you gotten roadhead gentlemen gentlemen gentlemen i state on my name i want you to very understand this very very carefully no woman has driven any of my cars ever million bugatti that she's never  driven before and i'm going to allow her to risk that i'm going to allow myself to risk that asset just to hope she might suck a little bit of dick when i can just  someone else you're out your  minds would you let me let them drive never what about one of the lower end ones  what about danica you just think they're gonna crash it it's not one i think they're gonna crash it that's part of it two why have you been in like a bad situation because you said your shit's based on life experience you know you've been in like a bad women driving situation you know what it is i'm a chess player right yeah so it's not just about what did happen or what could happen it's about understanding the reality of what guaranteed will happen and the fact that no i wouldn't understand that that's good i won't understand something the fact that i know what would happen in a hypothetical even though that hypothetical is extremely unlikely is enough to prevent me from doing something so let me give you an example let me break this down let's say i let the girl drive my bugatti but the chance of her bugatti i get bugatti okay okay let's set up a girl drive a car yes a girl drive a car and the chance of her crashing is less than one percent very low chance what's the big deal but if she did crash the results of that crash would infuriate me to a new level in which i've never been infuriated is it worth that risk even if the risk is very very small but would you let one of the boys drive it yeah boys just fine i'll tell you why i'm trying to get to the point because people think you're sure she's gonna crash she probably won't crash but you don't understand it's like me saying to you would you roll a hundredsided dice but if you lose you die you're like well no the odds are low but the consequences are big so even though the odds are low the consequences are big and i'll tell you why the consequences are big of a female driving your car because females have no innate responsibility or honor so a  crashes your car if you're a boy you give your boy a car right he crashes it bro i  up i'm gonna pay this off i'm gonna get to work i'll get another job man i'm sorry  crashes your car well it wasn't even my fault that guy came out of nowhere i didn't even know i didn't even know loads of money and you have loads of cars just buy a new one and i can't afford it and then and if you get too tough to her looking at her  pay she's just going to block you and  some other guy that's all that's going to happen some  like that he's pretty right okay he's right some  like that happened to me bro this girl scratched my car with her nails and i've seen it on my camera car and she tried to be like oh you got money what are you worried about you've got money you're all right they have no responsibility if they were to take responsibility for the issue to the point where look i  up i'm gonna pay this they won't so why the  am i gonna take the risk when i know they they would crash my  supercar and not give a  but girls don't like confrontation at the end of the day though i mean girls don't know wrong girls girls don't like responsibility for  girls don't like responsible they want another man to be responsible for  everything they want to come along and say we're equal to the dog until it comes to responsibility then oh  someone's got to pay the bill where you're a man oh  that's our responsibility well that's not my responsibility and that's fine right because it's our duty to protect and provide i'm sexist it's our duty right so i accept that i don't want a woman who sees herself on my level in terms of responsibility because i find that unattractive but the point i'm trying to make is i won't let a woman drive my car because i know what would happen if she crashed it we'd end up breaking up because she would not be sorry enough i'd resent her ass and dislike her for it she start giving me attitude and i'm gonna lose a  and a car what's the point didn't you didn't you do you did say that uh girls are not good with like their instincts or not instincts but uh they're not quick thinkers they're not quite you're talking about the pilot i remember you talking about the woman you walked out yeah i don't know yeah on my private jet can't be a woman pilot no sir it's got me a man and and and once again so yeah i'm sexist right no i'm sexist i'm sexist at school i recommend any man out here do this get get a ball get phone ball won't hurt nobody say to your boy think fast throw it at him five not maybe four times out of ten he'll catch you do it to a chick just do it dig fast straight in her mouth they catching the ball now now this makes me sexist that's fine but let me just explain something i also there are scenarios where i'll make fun of men the same way saying that women are a million times better and said scenario so i'm not talking like i hate women i'm talking about in my life experiences there are certain scenarios where if i want pure competence and i'm looking for the most competent individual their gender is related to that competence and it goes the other way also there are scenarios where i would only trust a woman over a man and most women when women first hear what i say they get annoyed but if they have a brain they sit there and go you know what he's right i can't i wouldn't want to drive a bugatti that fast he's right i wouldn't want to be responsible for the shipping fees of a yacht he's right i probably can't catch a  ball flying at my face randomly but you know he loves me and takes care of me and i'm gonna do my part and he's gonna do his part all right what are those things that you would trust a woman with in life so women are absolutely hardly fiercely loyal if she loves you the reason people get confused because people say hoes ain't loyal and stuff and women ain't loyal women are not loyal if they don't they don't love you because women are loyal to their own emotion only so if if they love you and then they stop loving you they don't give a  if you  live or die that's just females as a whole right but if a woman is truly in love with you women can be more loyal than anybody like i have a virgo real team and i have loyal boys completely but if you have a woman who's truly about it and truly in love with you man have you haven't you seen all these  serial killers and their wives help them hide the body and  like you could get women who are loyal they're down down they're like okay let's hide it like you get women who are truly loyal so in certain scenarios we need absolute loyalty you need to use a female if i were to have kids and i would drop them off at a play school would you ever drop your kids to an all male play school all men watching the kids i don't know it's weird isn't that weird it is weird it's  weird you'd only drop to all women right you trust them to be more nurturing you trust them to be more patient i wouldn't want to drop my two years if i had two maybe a couple gay males mixed then maybe but if i had a twoyearold yeah okay yeah but it's primarily a feminine environment because there's a patience that's there if i had a twoyearold i wouldn't want to drop it to an allmale environment because i think well what if she starts screaming and the men get pissed off and like the men might lose their temper it's weird it's just  odd no so there are certain things that are just set for females so things are just set for males women are very very good at certain things if i was sick i wouldn't call my boys you want a chick to nurse you when you're sick and a woman who truly loves you will sit with you in bed while you're sick risk getting sick herself and hug you all night women are amazing a bunch of  100 but i'm not gonna sit here and say that chick can drive  car as well as i can because she  can't she can't and i'm not afraid to sit and tell the truth if it's dark at night raining heavy in the middle of the mountains in romania where there's bears and  potholes and cows and  in a  lambo at three in the morning she doesn't even want to drive any woman who sits there goes i could drive this home as well as you is a dislikable person because you're  one you're lying two you're not gonna risk our lives to prove some point wreck my car then be unaccountable for it well you're rich anyway get another one why are you being rude to me i'm going on a girl's holiday bye and i'm left with a busted lambo so the answer is simple you do not drive my  cars the patience part yeah it's  um it's  and everyone knows i'm right and any man who thinks i'm wrong give a chick a car and wait for her to crash it and see how accountable is she is see if she will get a second job to pay that off he won't  no she will she doesn't give a  um what the  we appreciate that can we switch up and talk a little bit more about your businesses like the web we talk about half of them some of them yes what about the webcam business i'm not even in that i've been in that business like six years all sorts of universities well first of all i want to know too like how did when did you really start like popping off with all this  like you're right now on the internet you're  everywhere like you're like a  viral virus yeah pretty much right like you're everywhere so like how when did you start like really popping off i've been on the internet a while man doing what like what did you start first ever doing on the internet contentwise all right so uh i've had a youtube and  but it was small for a while my first money i made on the internet was the webcam thing i've talked about it in a lot of podcasts at length but i can explain again how it all happened this is a long time ago this is maybe six seven years ago this was before only fans it's before making money on the internet was such a big thing like now everyone you meet every 19 year old me does some drop shipping does that but back like seven eight years ago meeting a guy who made money purely on the internet was quite unusual everyone had like real jobs and  the world's moved on fast so making money online was not what it was today and uh i did i it's a really long story but  it  it we're all in the biggest podcast in the world i'll tell it so i owe some money to some dangerous people we won't tell that story but i needed money fast and uh i had 70 grand i needed 100 to stay alive and i wasn't fighting for a while that was times only way i was making money so i thought you know what i'm sitting there i had 70 grand cash in my house i'm sitting there and i'm like you know what sometimes tate god just loves you and you just get lucky you're gonna go to the casino you're gonna make the 30 so i told tristan my plan he's like bro what if you don't do it like bro i don't do it we're  anyway like we they're gonna get us eventually round up dead so i took 20 of the money went to the casino and lost it all so i came home now what did you play in the casino right so i know the odds i know that statistically the best odds are blackjack and i know that you can memorize perfect strategy in blackjack which i've memorized so i know that you have the statistical best odds in blackjack if you memorize perfect blackjack strategy which i have done what counting cards it's not counting cards it's just knowing when to hit when this is one understanding etc um so i but i prefer roulette and the reason i prefer roulette even though the odds are trash is because i feel like in roulette i have no control so what if i lose i feel i have a clearer conscience because i just put the money down i ain't got anything to do with it whereas if i hit when i go bust it's my fault and the fault annoys me how do you play roulette you just go red or black or do you do ends no i do numbers i have like five or six numbers i put a bunch on for like five numbers not too many and i just  let it spin like good numbers i i i yeah lucky numbers yeah we gotta run some steak after yeah let's do it bro i know a lot about gambling i know about the odds of gambling i know that there's absolutely nothing you can do on a roulette board that affect the odds of roulette so single zero let's 27 percent i believe a single zero roulette if you play for long enough you'll lose 27 of your money over a long enough period of time it doesn't matter how you bet doesn't matter if you bet on one number all the numbers don't matter about red black blah blah that's the stake built in so it really doesn't make a difference what you do so i just bet on these same five numbers that are my numbers for personal reasons and that's it so i lost 10 grand on roulette thought  it got up the odds went to blackjack stuck to perfect strategy got wiped out got  came home now i'm 50 g's down so i said to tristan we got a week pay this money i'm not gonna leave my bedroom until i find a way to make 50 grand so he's like all right cool because i think it was was it newton one of the one one of the scientists was a really weird guy and if he had a scientific problem he'd sit in his room and not leave until he worked it out so i decided to become a new one maybe it was him maybe it wasn't him so i'm sitting in my room so i started thinking okay let me approach this logically i'm a very intelligent man let's do this what do i need let's start at the very beginning what do i want money what is money so i started researching what is money what is money how does it work federal reserve fractional reserve banking interest inflation data and by the time i got to the end of about a day and a half's research on money i was really pissed off because i realized that money is  it's not even  real and i don't have any so now i'm double mad because i'm like this is  imaginary trash linked to nothing and i ain't got none so i was really pissed so i'm watching all these  videos and doing all this research on like assets liabilities blah blah and i got a piece of pen and paper i've been taking notes the whole time and i got to the port i was trying to write down my assets so i got a bmw what's that worth 22 grand something i had a rented apartment uh i'm big and strong but i'm already fighting i'm smart but i'm already using trying to make money i'm just writing down everything i have and i have like these five girlfriends from fighting all around the world right so i'd fly to paris and knock someone out i'd  a ring girl and then she'd be like oh you're the champ you're the champ like yeah i love you too baby and i'd leave and they'd think like i was this big baller in london i mean i had an apartment in a nice car my life was fine but i also had some problems from previous life which i can't talk about on the internet and uh they were still in love with me so i was texting all these  whatever whatever so i had these five girlfriends in these five different cities all around the world so i thought well are the girls an asset well they have beauty beauty is valuable so i guess they're an asset maybe they can like lend me the money or get jobs and pay me the money or some  because i need to pay this money i'll pay them back but i need to make this money so i wrote them down anyway i was thinking again what can these maybe these can these chicks help me in any way one of the girls offered to lend me like five g's or something it didn't really help and i'm sitting there thinking can these chicks help me anyway and i'm not a ruthless person i'm really not an evil person they're trying to paint me on the internet i am not the guy who's gonna put a  on the track i'm not the guy who's gonna hard pimp a  make her  dudes i'm not that guy i don't like those kind of things i don't want to touch my chick strip club maybe but then to open a strip club you need money right how to  you open strip club no money you need to build a strip club it takes money so i'm sitting there and i'm i'm googling on the internet like strip clubs or or i was googling like uh remote jobs london trying to see if there was some remote work i could tell my girlfriends to do online remotely to get the money and i could tell the guys look i'll have the money by this day and then between me and them and more the incomes i can pull the money and get the money boom boom and while i'm looking at remote jobs in the corner one of them little videos comes up talk to live girls now you know those  things are on the porn sites i've never i've never been a porn guy i still am not to this day i don't see the attraction in porn i've never really been a porn watcher i can really stay under god i've less i've watched less than an hour of porn in my life i don't find it interesting i don't watch it i don't go on the website you never ripped never not my thing it's just boring so i've never been a porn guy so i didn't know how big like chatting to girls on the internet was so i clicked on this advert there's some chick sitting there talking to dudes bringing money putting money on one of these websites and i was like i wonder how much she's getting so then i start looking into this webcam thing and i realize these girls are making a bank this girl's making  money so that was the plan i was like all right cool the girl's gonna be webcam girls so i originally thought i'll set them all up remotely and they'll do it all from home and send me the money but the problem with that i'll have one as well if you don't mind yeah gabe can i get it thank you thank you bro cool cool so but then i thought you know what i'm going to be teaching all these girls how to make as much money as they want are they really going to give me the money you know am i going to end up with the money or is this going to go bad for me plus now they need tech i'm gonna have to send them money to buy tech do i really trust the  to send the money is she gonna work hard is she gonna set it up right this might all go wrong so the only answer is i gotta bring them all to me and i gotta be in charge so i flew all five chicks in none of them knew about each other nothing thank you sat down at a nice restaurant me tristan he flew two i flew five seven girls so look about to get rich this is my plan i'm gonna do this i put a spin on it of course big boss big g got a big opportunity this money's been invested i've always wanted you to live with me now's your chance you can leave paris you can leave croatia you can leave whatever you come live in london with me you're going to do this you're going to be rich i'm gonna be rich blah blah blah put a spin on it you're all gonna live here of my five girls obviously they all kicked off who's this  who's a  who's a  look you're all mine get over it talk about money now there's a higher purpose but you  her yeah i  her who cares well talk about money you try my millions get over it some of them got upset they'll start arguing whatever whatever three left two stayed and that was the beginning of the empire the two stayed bought some laptops sat them down said look you're gonna get this bunch percent and get this much percent wasn't exploitation they want to do it they were like yeah this this could  make some money all right well cool let's try it and me and these two chicks started the company from the ground up and we started doing 15 16 17 hour days now when the girls were at the computer working i was at the computer the entire time because another thing i learned from doing this business i learned something about women is that they are intrinsically i don't want to use the word lazy but i will they they have no they have no interest in world conquest they want to be comfortable if you show a woman how to make a thousand dollars an hour she'll think i can work a thou i can work two hours a week if you show a man how to make a thousand dollars an hour he'll think i can make 18 000 a day we want to conquer the world we want all of it we want all of it not to cut you off but i agree with that completely and only fans have proven that it's proven it they're lazy about it they're like give me enough for food and rent can't be bothered lazy they're lazy so we didn't have time for lazy right so i was like no we ain't got time for that we gotta make all of the money but we made this much today not enough there's more money in the world it's ours all of it's ours i got to the point where i was so obsessed with it i'd be sleeping in bed because the chicks would eat me one each side i'd wake up to go piss and when i by the time i finished pissing i was awake enough to say all right two hours sleep that's enough get up back back to work we're gonna  kill it so me and these two chicks and they were about it right because they're getting money as well me and these two chicks we start we just start  hammering the webcam game problem is another thing i knew when i talk about what women don't find that men that women don't know what men find attractive the earlier on this podcast everything i said the pot the webcam company was running proof that perfectly the women who were on stream were beautiful but they didn't have a  clue what to say they were saying all the wrong  man every day they were saying the wrong  and we were losing customers everything i was telling you earlier about wanting to be innocent they're saying oh i've been here i've been there like shut the  up you're talking to some dude you just want to hear who we've been he knows you can't be a whole you can't be a 10 talking about how you've been to dubai with to some  dude in minnesota who's fat he ain't going to ever believe that he's going to get you that way you got to lie to him she's like lying say what say that you've never been anywhere because you don't trust men you can't find a man who's serious make him think that if he's serious about you that nothing else matters you gotta put a famous on it so i'm trying to teach these women and the women kept  it up so i said to said to him it's like you know what  it i'm taking over so what i did is i unplugged their keyboards and plugged a new one in from me behind the screen so the chicks would sit there and hit a keyboard that wasn't plugged in and me and my brother eventually some staff i trained would do all the talking the girls were just pure just for moosers just laughing and doing this the titties out and they were talking to  ice cold hustlers we were taking their money all of it if they they come and say what kind of all of it we're  milking them dry women haven't got a clue how to famous a dude they don't have it because they rely on their looks they don't have any of the intellect they have no gain nothing they're saying though you get a man with game and give him a female's body a female avatar you will  a guy up i had these guys selling their houses life savings loans all of it to me give me it all so like and it's it's basic  right you'd have a god bad or no  no to give you a solitary  did you tell like i don't give a  if you if you run an alcohol store you can't feel bad for people that pay that  yeah if you're on an alcohol store yeah and and most of the people you sell to enjoy alcohol but a couple of the people you sell to are alcoholics do you feel bad no no right so if you've been going to hell yeah that's the case if you come and you enjoyed it and spoke to the girl and spent what you could afford to spend cool if you turned up you're an idiot and got a loan out is that my problem no so i'm famous in these dudes right so the guy would be like what kind of what kind of guys do you like and if he was a young man i'd say i can't believe i'm talking to some young guy all these old creeps around here oh my god you're so handsome why are you even here if he was an old guy i would say oh my god i'm finally glad to talk to you all these young creeps keep coming talk to me i want a guy who's serious he's ready to settle down i know older men will settle down sell the dream sell the dream sell the dream we got to the point we had these guys falling in love with my models serious big time in love right sending crazy money and they were convinced they were going to meet the chick this is almost where i kind of felt bad because they were like can we meet i've sent you 200 thousand dollars can we meet can we meet can we me and in about a year i know if you don't feel bad at all why the  would i yeah i don't feel bad either so thank you so um they'd want to meet the chick right i only did a meeting once ever i had a big customer with my best girl how much did that cost he paid 50 gs for dinner just dinner it was clear it was just dinner he booked a really nice restaurant in london it was me my brother and about four of my other kickboxing boys on different tables because he doesn't know what we look like right so he's gone to dinner she's sitting at the table he's sitting at dinner he's surrounded by killers he doesn't even know casey was casey was weird or tried to drug her or some  right so we sat there at dinner had the dinner or whatever whatever dinner ended nothing happened but after they meet the girl once the fantasy's now ruined like so now they're like okay when can we meet again when can we meet again you said you liked me you said you loved me hey why don't you stay over they start getting really pushy and you end up like losing the customer because you can't keep me in him without nothing happening girl doesn't want anything to happen so you got kind of keep it in the fantasy world so we learnt from this after this girls cannot meet guys under any conditions so what the girls would do is they promise meetings and here's maybe this is a bit bad here's where the famous would start so it'd be good like i had a lot of girls who worked for me and the best was like the ukrainians or the russians it was amazing because they get some guy fall in love that they'd arranged today to meet all this  ah i need a visa okay visa i need money for a visa okay how much is visas nine hundred dollars no but it's not nine hundred dollars because i went to the embassy they think i'm a risk and i need a return flight there and back and i need a hotel i need to have spending money in my bank account they won't let me come or how much you need all right 10 grand boom 10 gs thanks wow go to the embassy take a picture outside the emcee boom come back they rejected my visa they said we have to wait two weeks after two weeks they'll give it to me okay baby boom two more weeks of tips boom boom boom boom boom because now we think he's gonna  right think we get the girls now he's spending more than ever two weeks two weeks two weeks two weeks come some other problem whether it's visa or whatever whatever we make up some  right all these only fans chicks can learn from you but you know people people people watch three only fans tutorials yeah people who people people would say why did those girls work for you because the girls would work for me and at 50 because it was 50 50 would make millions per month if they worked for themselves they'd make  nothing i was the best in the  game me and i had a whole team of staff the girl the girl would only work six or seven hours a day online so how did it end bro the story's just begun oh you want me to tell you i could shut up if you want you could have double dipped and started a coaching to coach these guys too right i could have but  i'll give off for free because i'm rich already but so the girl would be online for six or seven hours but then when she logged off was sleeping or whatever on her whatsapp i'd have staff she was online 24 hours a day her whatsapp her this she was famous in when she was asleep we were bringing money for the  sky we were promising all these meetings all these pictures outside of embassies all this  eventually the girl what she would do is she'd say oh i don't want to go emcee she'd give a really lame excuse to try and provoke the man to get angry so she'd say the embassy want me to come back but i have a headache that was the one we'd use he'd be like i just sent you a million dollars you promised you were going to come you said you had to delay next time you have a  headache and you won't go to your appointment to make him mad on purpose because that would annoy any man and then that's what we needed we need the little trigger we go why are you being aggressive i'm not being aggressive but you're not serious and then we'd say but you know what i i really like you and i'm flying to the other side of the world by myself and now you're being aggressive and now i'm intimidated and we'd flip it on him saying well now you're being scary no i'm not being scary but you know it's your appointment you're supposed to go yeah but i feel sick and you don't even care female  female  and flip it on him flip it on him and he'd get  furious because we were really good thank you yeah poking him to the point where you go like you're a  scammer you  scam me get really mad i can't believe you think i was a scammer i was gonna come i went to the embassy you're a  liar every man in my life has only lied to me i thought you were different big big beef big argument big argument but here's the thing the guy would get pissed off right and leave stop tipping her stop coming to her but for these men that's the only chick in the world the only hot chick in the world who talks to him maybe it takes a week maybe takes two weeks maybe takes three weeks he's in bed at night alone jerking off looking at her old videos and pictures watching her stream again from another account so she can't see it's him sitting there going maybe she was gonna come maybe i just got too mad when she had a headache maybe maybe i maybe i should have been a little bit more patient and she would have been my girlfriend and a hundred percent of the time in less than three months they'd be back with an apology a brand new pile of money and the cycle would repeat we  killed the game millions of dollars a week and it was not just because i had beautiful girls it's not because webcam is easy it's because i am a genius and i put together an apparatus of genius behind the avatar of beauty and we  conquered the internet wait so did you did you get these girls okay second did you give these girls like kind of like a cut yeah so no 100 to you well we talk about this so the girls who worked for me purely just work were working for me purely just work okay right so that only applies to our relationship yeah so that'd be 50 if a girl was my girlfriend she'd be working i'd get all of it now that doesn't mean she wouldn't have a nice life right because she's my chick now so like why would they even do it if they give you 100 though because cause what's your point i'm just helping you out i mean no it's all about helping me out it's about we are now a power couple we're a team and i'm gonna spend the money on you i'm gonna spend it i'll buy you a bag i'll buy you shoes whatever i'm investing i'm it's not even 100 i'm in charge of the money yeah not that you can't have things it's not that you can't do things not that you're  flat broke i'm in charge of the money 100 g's just came what do you want to buy i really want this bag you bought a bag last week i really want this one okay here's the bag what else do you need nails food okay cool well i'm paying the rent is there anything else you actually need no all right then let's invest this it was more very much like i was in charge of the money otherwise she was just spunking it on dumb  so it wasn't i say 100 percent they have a loser's their  mind but basically it was the more intelligent competent individual inside of the pair was in charge of the money me and and she also has have you ever pulled that off what do you mean pull that off like have you ever dated an only fan's chick that's gave you 100 of the money all the time no way i'm describing to you right now my all the tricks give me all them all the money i was in charge of it so do you put your bank info on their only fans account or do they pull it out and then they pull it to me they wired it no problem no way what if they cheat you how do you respond wait what if they cheat you but this is the interesting point the reason this dynamic worked is because the girl understood that she wasn't making the money it was my money because she understood that she is nothing but a face to a genius apparatus i have created she could be replaced i can take another girl of equal beauty sit her down in front of that keyboard which ain't even plugged in  and do this and make the same  money you are lucky to work for me because i can replace you you cannot replace me there is no other genius on the internet doing this the way i do it so it's my money it's my staff who've been up all night while you're asleep what's happening this dude it's my team who tell you who know what to say it's me who's been in charge of the plan to make sure he sends x amount before x that because we it was  it was a real business and the reason we were so successful is i was never thirsty about it most dudes in those scenarios would be trying to live like dan b and all this  i love what he does cool guy's a g but i wasn't trying to live like that i didn't want to go to the club with a bunch of girls i didn't want to be seen on the street with a bunch of girls i still have enemies at this point i don't mean walking around with  beautiful women's liability i was lowkey hiding pure business i wasn't  all the time no work we were there to make money the fact that i was surrounded by naked women did not care i was unphased unfazed you put me in a room with 20 of the most beautiful woman you ever seen stark naked didn't give a  walked straight in spreadsheets didn't care i was course i  but i'm saying i was about the money i approached it as a professional i was a professional to the game that's why we killed it another thing we did we don't talk about psychology i can tell you man i can talk about this right real quick what's the most expensive thing ever about a girl this is straight on tick tock oh um i bought some really expensive  for girls but you have to also approach it to bound to how much she may so like if a girl made a million dollars in a month and i bought her let's say a 50 grand watch so yeah i bought a fifty thousand dollar watch but she made a million dollars does that really count you're gonna go more that's pretty cheap it's yeah yeah it's cheap so it's like uh like i've never bought a girl anything too but never bought a girl a car the reason i'll tell you okay so i have so many angles you can go from here the reason i like splashing on chicks though i i love my woman to experience the world through me yeah that requires money but i would never like get with a brand new chick and just start buying her   no  no but if a woman truly loves me and there's an experience she's yet to have i would love to give it to her i'd love to give her something she's never had before but if i get a chick who's already had a bunch of it i'm less motivated in fact i know she ain't gonna get  if i get the chick who's had a bunch of ballers before then she can  herself  her get by goodbye she ain't worth  anyway but if i get a chick of innocence i'm interested in showing the world in all realms including financial that's the answer to the question i think you understand what i'm saying yeah she loves me it's impossible for me to be with a chick and her not have a good life right how can i have a chick with me she's my girl and my life's so fantastic what's she gonna get a taxi when i get in my car yeah like i get not on my jet she has to fly commercial like i'd have to be a real weirdo to prove a point maybe she's gonna hurt that she's being near me your life's good if you're anywhere near tate you're living good but what are those signs though that make you see that like oh this girl actually loves me oh that's easy bro i've just been around the game all of these things i'm telling you i've lived i grew up this game is my game i know you're gonna get married you're gonna get married ever i'll never get married no why not i don't see i don't see the tactical advantage getting married if i decided to be loyal to a woman and be with her forever that's fine if i decide to have children with a woman that's fine but i decided to have a house with a woman and live with her sure possible it's not optimal but it's possible but the idea of just getting married in and of itself is completely and utterly fruitless i think it's for the woman the women enjoy it but women enjoy lots of things when they have to pay for organize anything sure she gets to show off on instagram organize nothing waste all my money and now the government's involved in a new area of my life i don't want the government involved the government is already involved in when i register a car all my money a bank account want to get a job want to buy a house government's everywhere right don't i just want to at least be able to walk around my dick without the government being involved now if i put my dick in another  my wife can go and say i have proof you're putting stick in another  go to a lawyer and go to the government he owes me this infinite that's adultery automatic this much percent the the so now the government is watching my dick leave me alone no no leave me the  alone like live lover i love her she loves me love you very much love you too cool we love each other that's fine okay would you say though like back to the other question would you say that if a girl is doing things for you in a way where they kind of bring value without you having to like coach them would you say they love you i i've experienced a lot of female love in my life i know that i know when women love me and and it's not hard to make a woman love you as a man i don't think it's really that difficult i have a lot of women who love me but this is actually the meta point i was going to say before you said that if a woman truly loves you she'll stay with you without that  so the women who go to their man marry me or i'm leaving they're done then why the  you marrying a  who's already thinking about she's already giving you conditions to  keep the relationship if a woman truly loves you and you sit there and say look i've been around the world i'm about it i know things you don't know signing that piece of paper is bad for me it's also bad for you it's bad for business shut the  up what about okay how do i know you love me because i tolerate you shh done no  wedding no bells no dress no bollocks it's all  and men fall into this trap but no man wants to get married there's another thing i'm gonna say and i i don't i'm not  on guys who get married get married it's your prerogative i don't give a  i'm just saying me i truly don't believe any man actually wants to get married he wants his woman to be loyal he wants his woman as a wife he doesn't want to be a husband he just wants to do it so she's less likely to cheat it's a degree of insecurity if i marry her she'll know i really love her and maybe then she won't leave if you really know your  ain't gonna leave you if you knew in the stars if god came down and said she's never gonna leave you never leave you she's yours you own her soul would you marry her the  no why she's mine it's done i know my chick ain't leaving me my cheeks ain't going nowhere so what the  am i marrying them how how did you like initially pop off in this recent success like when did it start i decided contentwise i decided to go over with my conquest about six months ago six months six months ago what was your strategy bro that's worth billions of dollars if i were to tell you right now what i have done that would be worth so do you have to understand how many people want to do what i have done this is unprecedented this has never been done before it hasn't been i've gone from obscure internet figure with a cult following of fans my my fans like my youtube channel for a while my guys who followed me from back in the day are like i am so furious i used to walk around and say have you heard of andrew tate and then would say no and i tell them what genius you are now everyone knows you're a  genius who spilt the vodka you ruined it you ruined it like all my my old school family can we get a lady to clean this up or we'll put that on the yacht clubs tab yeah yeah thanks y'all thank you but like i decided to go over about six months ago i put together a strategy and a plan it was extremely strategized it was planned is that public though the plan yeah no i thought it is kind of public strategies i i've heard everybody say everyone has these theories you can come out with your fears here's the theory that you offered to sell your content to pages pages would post your content and that would help them get views that okay well that's not true one but two you also have to keep in mind most people can't do what i can do because most people cannot be as entertaining as i am by simply just sitting down talking  definitely so i can sit down and talk  and be extremely polarizing so i have unlimited free content yeah you can give me a camera and i can sit for 12 hours a day and talk at that camera i've unlimited free content which makes it easy like if you're a big youtube channel that do like these giveaways or or you do these big pranks or that you it's you need planning you need a lambo you need a girl me i can just get a camera and just start talking iphone and i'll get 10 million views right so that's the first thing so i have unlimited free content it's the first thing so your content's really easy to make super easy to make which is dope which is dope the easier your content is to make the more competitive you are yep i'm super competitive because i need an iphone you give me an iphone and half a subject and i'll start running my mouth and people for some reason like to listen to me for free i have never paid for an ad i've never paid for a shout out i'm not paid on any of these big instagram pages i'm all over i ain't paid for  they're all giving it to me for free because they're like this will get us views tate that's that's it was that not correct then but you're saying i paid them no no i'm saying they reach out to you they don't even reach out to me they  steal it and i don't give a  that's another thing that's a big part of it is it like an organized effort it's an organization or do you even monitor them or not i put together a plan which was extremely well executed this is not an accident and i can't tell you exactly what i do but one of the other things i did which is the superpower is that i don't have accounts most people let's say you have a youtube channel you don't want people to plagiarize your  you want the views you want your money that you don't want people to rip your video use it i don't have an account everyone can steal my  i don't give a  you have a youtube account though now i have a youtube channel but even then i don't i don't i don't think it's even monetized i don't know a single paddy for me ours is we've never made money off youtube that's what i mean it's all right so i i don't need money right so if someone to come along and decide to take my video and chop it up and use it for something i don't care somewhere to come along and make a video attacking me i ain't gonna try and copyright strike don't care do it everyone do whatever the  they want with my  so i'm free game right so it's entertaining and it's accessible that plus my genius battle strategy we implemented it in january january 1st is when we began and i am now the most famous man on the planet i'm more googled than donald trump joe biden look it up i'm more on the most googled man on the  planet really yeah that's fact donald trump joe biden versus someone exposed that on the podcast and verified that's correct yeah so i'm the most googled man on the planet crazy i've conquered the world so is it mostly a ticktock strategy or social media as a whole i own all of it does it bother you don't make money from this  well you make money and through your ventures right right so yeah i already have what ventures do you have right now yeah i can't tell everybody everything i do but i have enough money forever like i i'm at the point of money now where it really truly has no value everything in the world to me is free and i grew up very very poor so i can still remember being poor i grew up with nothing truly my family my mother and father they got divorced when we were in indiana my mother moved back to england my father stayed in america my father unfortunately died my mother and my uh brother and my sister we grew up in a the free houses that the government give you so the projects of england in the town called luton which was voted the worst town in england with the highest crime rate blah blah blah live in a  area group with nothing and i've done all of this completely myself no financial help never got a loan from a bank a friend nothing did all of it complete by myself so i remember being broke and i really really am thankful for those poor days because if it wasn't for the days being poor being rich would suck it's bro it's  it really ain't that cool it's only cool because you can do  and say do you remember when we couldn't afford to do this yeah yeah otherwise it's boring right so i'm at the point now where absolutely everything in the world is free if a new car is launched and i see it let's say it's a brand new lamborghini right in fact i did this yesterday they're replacing the aventador there's a new lamborghini it's a twin tur it's hybrid it's a thousand horsepower that's all i know i saw an advert a youtube video on youtube in the explore page i didn't even watch the video of the review of the upcoming car i didn't even watch the four minute video i just saw a new lambo's coming text my lambo guy and said i'll have one i don't know how much it costs i don't need to choose options because i take every box every option give me one it'll come out the bank and i won't know this turn up everything's free if i want lambo it's free i've only got jets free give me yachts free besides mega yachts and mega mansions literally everything on the planet is free what's your main like public venture that you're doing right now that you could say right so i do a few things online so i i own some casinos yeah so i own some casinos in romania that's one of the first things i do really but i don't want to talk about that in too much depth but i have some casinos in romania i also have some more traditional wealth income methods i've got a proper portfolio across about 67 countries um i'm also an extremely capable individual in fact i wish i had my business card on me to give it to you but i'm the guy that people can come to that can fix things so i have a lot of people with a lot money who come to me and say look the war is going on i need to get someone out russia into europe or look i gotta move this money here that in a very legal way i know enough people to help do those things so i can make a lot of money with that online i have two serious ventures one is hustlers university and the other is the war room what do you do on those okay so the war room is is kind of like the illuminati but cooler the war room is is very the world is very difficult to explain but it's it's a private network it's a network in which you must compete for your place when i was saying earlier on this podcast about living with competitive men the warren's online version of that so you have men you join you pay you join there's tasks tests things you must do to keep your place or you're booted such as i can't tell you you can't say it's that private how much does it cost to join it's like five thousand it's not much it's five grand to join but you can get kicked at any moment without a refund so the point is that it's constantly winners right the losers are always peeled off the bottom so the winners get more and more competitive so we're cycling into a group so now we so now we have a point where we have does that relate to the tick tock fan page portfolio the war room are involved in everything i do how many users are there we have over 2 000 members over 600 millionaires what about a customer and we have extremely and we have extremely important people inside of the war room you can go to the war room i go to the war room for the problems no one else can fix like when the ukraine war when the war got when the war kicked off in ukraine and they closed the borders or the borders panicked we had seven war room members of ukraine we got them all out in 24 hours when are we sending jets so the war room helps you get  done the war room gets  done globally so that's what the room is it's a network and you don't want to say anything back on  if you get it or something so again and you'll give them some kickback on money that you get or something like that yeah it's it's the war room is a private network that's the most i can say can imagine the freemasons of old but better so when you first join the war room for the first six months inside you're just going to be doing things like why it's kind of like mr miyagi wax on wax off why am i doing this and then you're going to start to learn aha this is useful the people who are too lazy to do that i want to  join the people who are too lazy to do the wax on wax offer kicked how powerful is the network i'm alive are we allowed to talk about anybody else who's in there i will never tell you about any of the members but let's put it this way i'm still alive right so and and and uh there's been serious attempts on my life the worm is the most powerful network on the face of the planet today bar bar governments are you choosing our nation state the war room is bar nation state wanting you dead the war room is the number one enemy you wouldn't want you coming after you because they will get you we are that good are you trying to keep up being like as viral as you are forever or not forever but like for this is stage one of a threestep plan so i'm going to be viral for a little bit longer then step two begins the conquest is continuing so this is just the beginning because like a lot of people are saying like you're going to fall off soon this is just a minute no problem what's your take on that that's fine i've been around the internet for a very long time and i'm building systems which are very sustainable right the war room is a very sustainable thing i don't care if all this virality gets me one good war room member who can do what i need him to do or fill a gap in our organization which are very few and far between then i still win right so that's the war room then we have hustlers university the reason i started hustlers university is because i was arguing with someone about how pointless the modern education system is i think the modern modern education system is nothing but an indoctrination machine i think they use it to indoctrinate the youth i think it's a waste of  time what brainwashed people the brainwashed people of course they do and it's actually because i can talk forever the world's a spider's web right everything extrapolates from from everything else and most people are not capable of understanding that nearly every single idea or habit or lifestyle which is propagated mainstream by the matrix is done so with a trojan horse so even the educational meeting with a hidden agenda with a hidden agenda so even if you look at things like women's rights women need rights women need protecting women should be equal in the law completely agree they said they wanted women to work so people could pay more taxes no they want people to work so can pay more taxes double the tax base but you know what else they wanted them to work for get the kids out of the get the kids out of the influence of the parents right when the woman's at home and the father's at work those women sorry those children are learning from the woman who's probably learning from the father and you get to instill your own beliefs in those children government doesn't want that the government wants the children to belong to them so they get the woman at the house and they send you to school for as long as possible to reprogram you this is why you will see youtube videos of children arguing with their parents and their parents will say that's not true and the children will say i learned in school that a man can be a zebra or whatever they learned and they start arguing with their own children you don't own your own children's minds anymore because your children's mind is owned by youtube and the school right and the school will say to you if your parents ever yell at you or get aggressive to you you come to me and we'll tell the police don't worry about that so they're doing it to brainwash the children right because this is how you control the future so the whole educational system in and of itself is a scam they use feminism and the whole women's rights  to get everyone's children into the adulteration indoctrination machine they keep their you there as long as possible they want you to finish in debt because then you got a  job and become a good slave but they don't teach you anything of value nobody learns anything of value in school and everybody intrinsically knows this even the people who disagree with me i said if you see me pull up in my bugatti in a gas station do you look at me and think wow he went to school  no you think drug dealer gangster scammer you think i'm doing something illegal because you understand if i was staying within the paradigms of the system i couldn't have possibly achieved this the only way you can fathom i've done it is by imagining me as an outlaw because you know within the paradigms of society i shouldn't have even  done it that's how much you know school's a scam you don't look at someone rich and respect them thinking he went to school the people you are learning from in school aren't even  rich your business professors never had a business they're brokies they're  broke so school's a scam and it's the biggest scam on earth and the reason it's a scam before i get into the meta point the reason is to scam is because it operates in a vacuum it operates in a vacuum because it cannot be fairly compared to any other service so you can get a loan for school but you can't use that money for anything else because if they were to open it up and put the school the education system into the fair market of capitalism it would fail i've already give you 100 grand and say you can get a degree or you can buy a crypto or you can start your own business or you can do anything you want with it who's going to choose a degree no nobody so they say you can only get the money if you use it for education which allows it to operate inside of a vacuum because operates inside of a vacuum it is one of the few things on the planet which is allowed to be noncompetitive it's not competitive against any other investment everyone knows that but you can only get the money for that so you can't get the money to invest in anything else so you end up doing it learning something that is outdated slow to learn there's more it doubly inflates there's more degrees every single year meaning the value of a degree decreases and the price goes up every single year so it's worth less each year it costs more year on year there's no other industry where you can even get away with that you get wrecked except the educational system so i was explaining why it's all a  scam people say to me well what else am i supposed to do i don't know what else to do i said i'll tell you what i'll start school and my school will teach you how to make money because what do you want to work for oh i want to work for my passion that i've wanted for your passion  off what do you want to work for onward for money okay you're the guy i need you own it for money because there's people who really don't want to do what they enjoy that's fine you're never going to be rich that way go be a vet a vet you might be rich go work in the zoo and clean up pig  cause you get to be near an elephant that's your thing go do it your passion has nothing to do with getting paid so the people who are serious people are smart enough to go i only work cause i want money i don't care what i do i just want money cool then you can come to my school now my school's competitive my school does not operate inside of a vacuum it's 49 a month for houses university and we teach 18 modern wealth creation methods we teach 18 different ways to make money in the modern world which is very different from the old world which is a key point because people always say well my parents told me your parents lived in a different  world your parents bought a house for sixty thousand dollars and now it's worth half a million dollars so of course they're telling you to save up buy a house how you gonna buy a house for half a mil we're going to starbucks gee that ain't gonna happen right so all your parents advice is outdated in this  so all the old advice is  saving money is  inflation's like ten percent save you gotta get rid of your money  saving you gotta  spend it so everything they tell you is is wrong and old so it's all modern wealth creation 18 different model wealth creation methods it's 49 a month and you can spend that 49 anything you want you don't have to join my school you can go buy lunch if you want so i'm competing against the entire world right you can you can invest that in anything and people are still choosing my school that shows it has a genuine value at the point of this podcast where i checked this morning we have 108 000 students 108 000 students 108 000 in hustlers university correct whoa 108 000 isn't impressive that i've amassed it's impressive that i retain there are 108 000 people in the world who have joined my school for 49 a month and they say i am getting more for my money or more value than i'm investing here i'm either making more money back or i'm learning more than i would ever possibly learn for 49 anywhere else so i unlike traditional education genuinely compete in the world and i'm the only educational platform in the world that does this there's no competition at all and i do it because the people who join my school and listen actually make money now i've been accused of a bunch of  there is an affiliate system you can make money with affiliates that is a system that does exist inside that's one of the 18 ways you don't have to just affiliate for h you can affiliate for amazon products we teach how to affiliate for  anything so you can affiliate with for a bunch of  but there's 17 other ways to make money all inside of the school itself so we are the number one educational platform on the planet and i will say this now anybody who's serious about making money should be inside because 49 is not gonna help you in any other way in your life because there's no crypto you're gonna buy for 50 bucks it's going to blow up there's nothing else for fifty dollars you have  nothing to lose i'm not saying it's gonna be easy and that seems to be quick but we'll teach you how to make money if you're sit ready to sit there and learn so that's what hates you is so i hate you in the world of the two biggest things online so between those i'm doing okay when you say um like they want to get the kids out of the schools who do you think is like that's like some heavy like that's some heavy string pulling like who do you think is behind that like i know people just say it's the government but you know what i mean though to be that smart to say all right we're gonna separate kids from their parents so we can take over the minds of the youth that's like a very smart concept to think of do you know what i mean like how does someone come up with that is that you come up with it because it's natural human nature right like if you have a do you think that's like the government making those decisions way about the government like that's what i mean like who do you think is they there are people who've been in charge of the world for quite a long time and to keep it simple and to keep making sure this podcast stays up the people who control the money are going to control the world because if you have money you can influence people yeah right so and the government's what the governments need money so they're just they're a layer in the chain the government's the government's or the illusion of choice yeah it doesn't matter who the  president is especially right so the true matrix people who truly control it they want as much influence and power as possible this is human nature if you have a company you're not going to hire employees who disagree with you and don't listen to you you're going to want them to be as compliant as possible just like you're going to want your woman to be as compliant as possible who you are as a man right so if you're one of the most important powerful billionaires on the planet you're going to want as much power over the world as possible you want people to be compliant so you're going to look for that outside support structures and attempt to attack them if you have a girlfriend and she's 100 and she listens to you except she has this one friend who's always in her ear talking  you're going to say don't be friends with her anymore so if you're trying to teach the children x but their parents are trying to teach them why you're going to say we need them to spend less time around their parents so how do we do that we need the parents to be more busy we need them to go somewhere that's just like some crazy control  that is what i'm saying but that's what that's what they've done yeah it's on purpose like it's very very purposeful it's all done on purpose the average person doesn't understand that like that statement means that like there's people above us that are just trying to control us right oh completely there's people in charge above us trying to control us all i mean if the last three years haven't proved that i don't know what's going to prove it to you like there's definitely people who want to control us because all of us every man on earth has an innate instinct for power and control we're not we're all human we're not pure creatures the reason you guys love doing this podcast is because you love being big and getting more followers and getting more influence what is influence it's power it's control that's what you want it's what i want it's what everyone wants if you get to a certain level in life that's what you want now you're gonna have power and influence over a whole bunch of people you may believe it's not even necessarily evil you may believe that you're helping them they don't understand the world they're the little peasants they're the ants i'm the big billionaire i'm going to teach them things they don't know they need to learn yet their mother is outdated she's in their ear we're going to separate them so i can help the kids they may think they're doing it for a good reason but what they're really doing is trying to propagate their own personal world views on other people as we all do as you do as i do et cetera they've just managed to have a lot more influence and more power to do it right so you talk about governments the  is a government governments are bought and sold that's that that's all  right but there's people in charge of the world who want us to listen when they talk and they're going to do their very very best to stop anybody or stop any kind of power support structure which is going to prevent that it's done on purpose this is why they also try and ensure that the people of most nation states are in fighting this is why government and politics everything is the biggest lie in the world you have democrats and republicans arguing with each other all  day when there are two sides of the same coin and the people in charge of all of it are laughing bro if you had to fight 100  cats right you'd probably get through it but it'd be a bit messy the first thing you want to do is turn 100  yeah 100 what i take 100 cats easy yeah snap the next like  rambo point is you'd want to turn all the the white cats against the  yellow cats first start civil war first let's get them uneasy we don't working together on me now let's let's mandy well you're democrats you're republican you're black you're white you're brown you're gay you're straight you're a man you're a woman you're this you're that you're this you're that and everyone's gonna sit there and  argue all day and they're gonna sit the top laughing there's more of us than there is of them but they don't think that they're very very smart it's divisive how do they get that smart it's because it's it's age old bro this just been around for families that have learned as long as families it's it's just age old if you look at how but that's like really smart  look at how england look at how england conquered india england conquered india with less than a hundred thousand troops there was millions of indians and the supply line is nine months long how do you do it you turn up you turn one team against another team one family gets another family one tribe against another tribe arm one side they start winning oh  we need to take some power back arm the other side to do basic foreign policy that's internal policies basically that's how it's always been and then before you know it who runs india the british that's how you do it right is how america does most foreign policy today it's how the world functions you cannot have people united you can't have people united if you have all the people inside your country united they're not going to stand up for  i'm sorry they're not going to stand for  they're going to stand up for  secretly though we are a lot line but the media just thinks that we're not no the media doesn't think that the media makes convinces so they know they know the media is the machine the media is the weapon that they use to protect yeah it's sad so that all of this is very very purposeful the people in charge of the world do it on purpose of course it's not on purpose um but you're saying like why did they come up with these ideas or how is it done because they wouldn't because i know why it's just the how is like they're just geniuses it's almost scary like to come up to sit for people to sit in a room and say all right now we're going to target the youth and we're going to take we're going to implement the system to take away the youth from their parents is like some scary smart there's a problem scarier  than that i know that's nothing they're doing much scarier  than that like and and it's just the beginning so but if this wasn't a public podcast i'd love to talk about this in far more detail but it's a public podcast and the war room's good but i think we did good why don't we go yeah smoke another cigar out there maybe crank a beer and  i think it was good yeah you're a  legend bro we appreciate you what's what's some what's some closing statements closing statements can i ask you one more thing though man man i'll talk forever let's go real quick back to the lines if like you're in the club if you're in the club and there's like a chick it's not lying it's not number two okay body count and there's a drink that has ten and then there's one that has one who are you going for that you know you have a better chance of sleeping with uh i would have a better chance of but that's the thing dude that's the thing honestly okay well then i'll i'll answer that question yeah answer that because all right i'll answer that question because it's a bit of a trick question yeah i can't be tricked because i'm a professional because when the question was originally asked it was who would you prefer yeah and you said you would prefer the one with more okay right so we would still prefer the one with one yeah now because there's a higher probability of sleeping with the hoe that's true doesn't mean she's preferred doesn't mean that's the preference and the true answer is you would try with the girl with one and if you failed towards the end of the night you'd end up around the girl attack that's what would happen okay so that that's what would actually did i really say preferred earlier you said preferred yes okay that's my fault i  that up yeah who's doing anal what the hell all right we're good i mean like no but this is another thing i i don't know man maybe i'm getting old this is my closing statement maybe i'm getting old i'm 35 right i've seen the world change in real time i remember the world before the internet and i've seen the rise the internet and i would say now i'm big on the internet and stuff and i just think the world i used to i understand when i was young and i used to like something and old people would say turn that off it's degenerate i'd be like it's just a video game or it's just a song i'm becoming that guy yeah i'm becoming that guy now where i hear things or i see  the world's just so degenerate now oh 100 i see like these girls like twerking on a boat or dudes just to pop in pills i just i don't know it's just all so degenerate and when now that degeneracy angers me it's made me almost it's changed me to a degree because even you're just talking about banging chicks whatever i really have no interest in just tearing through chicks i just think it's degenerate i just think i think guys are degenerate too yeah no of course men in our and women are i just think it's a degenerate attitude like i could sleep with thousands of women i just think it's maybe i'm just bored of it i don't know but i'm just kind of like i'd rather have one or two or five give me five girls and i'll settle down five lives that's enough i'm not gonna be mr one one vagina i'm not you know i'm not i'm not gonna be missed one hoe is too close to noho so we're not gonna go down that road but but five is enough to give me a buffer of space to replace one if she gets out of line whatever give me five chicks i'll settle down right now but to actually be running out there and just really tearing through it i just think maybe i'm just bored of the game maybe maybe it got too easy but i i don't know even sex in and of itself i just think is it that good you don't think one woman could please you like fully i don't think one woman is capable of completing a man's life absolutely no i think you need a wife sexually but i think i think you need a wife and you need hoes yeah you need both i don't think there's times because i mean there are times where like i mean there are times where you do i just love it bro you're so funny that's true i think i think with five wives things around the house things in general would just be more efficient you know the best thing about having multiple women i'll tell you from my webcam days do they interact with each other do you suffer oh no they're super interactive cause i only told like twenty do they get jealous though yeah but they got jealous but it's hard to get jealous this is about the social paradigm it's hard they of course they got jealous and i would reassure them until everything's okay but they would never disrespect me openly because no one else did you don't be the only disrespectful  then you get kicked out yeah it's not it's not it's not the societal norm this is why in america everyone's fat because it's normal you go to russia or ukraine there's very few fat people because you don't want to be seen fat because no one's fat so everyone's going to be like what the  you obese for do you understand what i'm saying it's a societal norm if every chick is coming up to me and treating me like god you don't be the only chick with an attitude because you feel embarrassed plus plus yeah of course i had that plus you get kicked out yeah what are you used to i get your i get your strategy now girls get kicked out and then when they got kicked out they'd fail because they're naturally lazy so then when a girl when the girl got kicked out we'd have a we'd have a party every time a girl every time i fired a  we'd have a party sort of a party and and not make fun of her but just like one less hoe last one standing gets the sun we make a joke and all this  so we kicked the girl out we have a party and and girls would instantly not like turn on her but girls are tribal right she's no longer part of the tribe she's she's stupid and we'd all kind of think and the part of the party is we we'd monitor her monitor her on camera so every day after she left we'd check on him how well she was doing how you can see them online how many hours they do they're ranking on the website how much money they're making and they go from way up here making millions to just slowly declining because they're lazy they're lazy they're lazy they fall off and end up down to nothing and then beg for their job back so that so so now girls are like if i leave he's gonna have a parties make fun of me and i'm gonna make any money and i'm gonna be another one the ones they mock and dinner so now girls don't want to lose their job right so girls didn't really disrespect me but we were talking about um of them being jealous yeah but i was about to say one of the best things about living with multiple women this is actually the best thing about it the best thing about living with multiple women is that all the girl  they do together so your girl if she right now if you have a girlfriend she has a group of friends all of those friends are your enemy every single thing they say to her is bad about you he doesn't let you go out hey why is he asking where you are why is he calling you it's only a boat party let's go here they're all negative you don't want your woman talking to them that's true now if you're  the same four girls that's true if you're  the same four girls then her friendship circle are all behaving and all you're positive towards you now so you don't have that negative influence which means you get to send her away with her friends all the time you have a girlfriend you don't want to send her away with her friends because they're up to bad  i love sending my girls away oh you want your nails done go boom oh you want to go see that  movie go go go the skirt oh oh you want to go go leave me the  alone you want to go ikea we need towels cool go to ikea i don't have to do none of the dumb  men have to do i see men doing all this dumb  with their chick because they don't want her to do with their friends man i've been ikea in a long time ikea is the most depressing place on the planet what if you're going to get sucks wait wait you're wrong if you go to ikea with five wives even worse i'll take this because i can send them five  by themselves i went to ikea about three years ago and i genuinely think it was one of the most depressing experiences of my life yeah that place i saw fullgrown men so busy and  too oh it's amazing i saw fullgrown men on a sunday morning walking around about the ikea hot dogs though they're all right they're pretty good but the sadness the sadness in the eyes of the fullgrown man on a sunday morning walking around and his wife is like picking up a towel you want this towel or this towel and you can see he doesn't give a solitary  it's his only day off it's his only day off he's been working for six days and she's like we need to go ikea steve he's like oh can't we not go we need towels steve he's like oh maybe i might get laid next month if i go ikea and he's standing there and she's like which towel steve and he's the guy like carrying the baby oh i don't know which one do you like babe i'm like oh this whole place is just depressing me i can't get out it's amazing everyone's  sexless and depressed it's  horrible  man but if i send the chicks they can  around all day in ikea don't give a  and you know what i can trust them because they're all vying for position with me if one of them even looked at a dude the other three would go we were in ikea and this guy walked past she she looked at this guy they're all right they'll all right to me i'm the big boys 100 well they're friends all right but they're all  reporting to me and on the sly i'm like look you're the only one i trust if anyone says anything tell me all four boom boom boom they're all coming to me going yeah i think she loves you but you know i don't know we were in ikea and she didn't talk about you the whole time they're all just  ratting ratting right so i could trust all of them cause they're all  spying on each other it was great i didn't have to do no  if you're with one  she's like i want to go see this movie like  no and he got like it's long you need multiple women so they can  off and do women  it's important you don't ever do like you don't you don't ever go on a date with like all five gods you've never been like yo i'm gonna treat all five of you tonight and go so i used to go i used to go to the club with all of them actually this is one of the big things about romania when i first moved to romania me and my brother went to the club and we walked in there and we saw like dudes like two gypsy dudes or two old dudes and they'd have like  dirty women on their table right so you go to a club in romania it's like 20 dudes 100 girls but the girls aren't accessible you can't go there as a tourist and pick them up because they all belong to people right so when we interested first went there by ourselves what happens if you do you're getting big trouble fast death yeah like it's not death it's just like they're gonna to be up it wouldn't be that fast like they take they'll warn you first they'll take the  off yeah and if you really push it then you you're dead yeah you get in trouble but um wow but the interesting went there we understood the vibe did it so when we went to the club because we saw where we ain't getting  here we're by ourselves we left after 20 minutes we went to the club ourselves next week but we had the cam business so we went ourselves with 20 girls so to the romanian like the big boys the bosses they were like whoa these are westerners not many western dudes have 20  on tap to pull out hotties and walked in there in romania in romania yeah we have all these chicks there we have chicks everywhere all around the world whatever we have different studios but um yes you're saying did i ever take my girls on dates girls are fantastic for status there's times where you want status you need women women are statists women are the inter true are the true currency of ballers  money it's women if i go to uh the bugatti dinner everyone there's rich everyone's got bugatti everyone's got rolex everyone's got a nice house everyone's got a boat who cares but who has the  but who's sitting there with two wives me you're sitting there with a hooker who doesn't really like you can see in her eyes you're sitting with the wife who's old and ugly you're still the  you don't  i'm sitting there with two wives who adore me and are both gorgeous who's the rich guy i could be the poorest man in the room but i'm the guy they want to talk to so women are the true currency of international ballers so you need to be able to pull hotties out your ass just for  status so you're saying do i take girls out not to give them fun or nothing to be scenarios in which yeah i need to bring the baddies it was pure status thing yeah i'll just roll up  ten baddies boom walk in boom that's it you get respected yes she's all over you no i'm gonna i'm gonna say something when you have a hot girl with you and you introduce her to somebody and you know she's hot it's like a yeah she's with me it's status it's a status so having hot women is about that yeah why are you laughing because he was that and i have felt that he was just being he's just no i was just asking him have you ever dealt with that yeah i have okay my dad and his friends are  75 so andrew you've never had a girl like kind of like intimidate you in a way where you're like  i'm kind of nervous around this chick no i'll tell you why yeah have you ever heard that no because i live in a very very let me be very correct in my language i live in a world which is i like to think i'm very true to the base instincts of humanity should i shut up no no it's good i love it this is our longest episode i think probably i got 10 more hours i like to think i like to think i like to think i live very true to the base instincts of reality and the base instinct of reality always has been to a degree violence i'm not a violent person i'm a very peaceful person but as long as i'm not threatened with violence it's very difficult for me to give a  about anything else and that's because i've been threatened with violence so many times and i've been in so many scenarios outside of professional fighting i've been in so many scenarios where i really thought i might die as long as that's not happening i don't really give a  so if i'm sitting there with a  and she's hot intimidated but she can't she ain't got hands she can't slip a jab she can't fight which like that's one of my that's one of my brothers shout out to my brother tristan that's one of his best sayings when he gets caught cheating or his girls go bust go crazy or they catch him do something his number first shane got hands so like what are you gonna do blow you up on whatsapp you're gonna block you oh don't block me you the  they can't do nothing so intimidated why how can i be intimidated by chick because she's hot i don't understand like i'm intimidated by certain scenarios where there might be a consequence or a repercussion if i go on a date and she doesn't like me cool give a  like are you still fighting or no see if scars on your knuckles yeah y'all stay ready my friend stay ready i saw you on a fight you want to fight jake paul so yeah i made the video saying i was going to fight jake paul when he first called out conor mcgregor remember when he did that first callout video no the first one was savage the savage i gotta be honest it seems beneath you though if you're as rich as you are you got the status why would you want to go fight jake paul yeah so i made that video when he he first called out conor mcgregor because i thought he was being distracted how is that beneath him jake paul's pretty  big pretty big but but i think that conor mcgregor at the time i thought that jake paul was just disrespecting fighters as a whole because fighting is a really hard life well back then it was like whoa but now i now it seems that jake paul is taking his books and careers very seriously yeah he's taking it very very seriously so i'm no longer angry at the guy because he's now a boxer effectively and he's using attention he's using uh pro pro uh provocative marking to make himself as much money as possible i of all people on the planet cannot sit here and and  on that oh my god yo so i get what he's doing right can you imagine a press conference him in another fighter talking  at a  press conference i would love to see you would you are you would you would you do that would you do some sort of largescale boxing fighter how about mma i i fought a year ago mma i sparked him i'm open to all things would you rather bawk because kickboxing no one's probably not really cares no one's watching i'll fight an air boxing doesn't matter to me i'm i'm very good andrew tate in the ufc yeah i'm open to it but it's a lifestyle that i lived for a very long time understand that from the age of 17 to the age of 27 for 10 years of my life all i did was train that's why now i can still jump on the pads and smash out 12 rounds easy often you train a week i still train nearly every day but to live that lifestyle it's it's it's a big sacrifice you got to dial in he's got a dial in so for me to do it i'm not saying i wouldn't do it it would have to be very worth it the problem is for it to be worth it people will say oh how much money and i have more money than anyone would possibly what class would you fight at 92 93 kilo which is like just just light heavy weight yeah do you have a guy that if you had to fight at the ufc you would fight or some fighter that comes wait how many pounds is that sorry i don't know i don't know pounds 195 200 light heavyweight um right yeah 205 is lightheaded kilos that means he's like yeah so anyway there are possibilities for things in the mix perhaps if i can find it it'd be worth it but it's just i'm now at states now where they go well it's worth it you get 10 million 10 million what a week's wage  six months training for that i don't need a week's wage for six months training and then they'll give you a little bit of extra exposure they'll go you get exposure that's what they'll say but i've already i'm already the most supposed to be i've conquered the world so um and then you talk about accomplishment i've had 87 professional fights i've been i've been doing a bunch of times four times world champion you know 71 wins i've i've done it i'm very competent and happy and comfortable with who i am as a man i know that 9999 on the planet or a onepunch issue and i'm fine so it's kind of like do i really want to do it there are people who i would fight i'm not going to say their names on this podcast but there are and there are scenarios there are things in the famous people give us one give us one no man we're working on it and working on some things for everyone to see i know i know everyone wants to see me  someone up that's what they want to see they want to see me smash someone up which is fine what is the percentage of people that actually know how to fight in the world well this is this is another thing because i actually don't believe in fighting outside of the cage or the ring i don't believe that fighting is is a real thing i don't believe fighting is real violence and fighting are different things so no so is that you saying like no one really knows how to fight outside of no i'm saying that it doesn't matter okay fighting and violence are the things so i i made that comment that most matter of one punch issue that's true actually recently a video which got taken down off my youtube but i'll give it to you guys maybe you can sneak it in um me and my brother were in the nightclub and some guys six guys were sitting on our shiron taking pictures and someone told us sitting on the hood of the car and we left the club we rolled up it's on cctv and me and my brother attacked the six of them and put them all asleep in romania so like we're still about it like it did this shit's like a movie bro but you know what you know what's cool wait where was this this is in romania oh okay me and me and tristan it's kind of like man because we grew up together we live together whatever and we know each other so well we can talk without talking so as the taxi pulled up we were literally praying they're still  around near our car right because they were sitting on the front of the car sitting on it and as the taxi pulled up we're both in the back seat and we both just turned to each other and went going out there start  smashing them no words no get off the car it's all on cctv you'll see i'll give you the video just start  knocking them all asleep so i want to see that  yeah but um but but this is the point that that that to a degree could be fighting but i don't think fighting is a real thing outside the ring because violence is a different thing i know truly violent people and i've been in truly violent scenarios and if someone is truly violent they don't need to know how to fight and i'm saying if someone who is violent wants you you're going to die violence is ten men with machetes violence is spread the medic violence is running over with a car violence isn't hey bro that that that's the olden days let's go outside have a  that's all gone now if you're if you're caught in altercations on the street no matter how big of a tough guy you are the best thing you can do is leave there are too many people who are ready to  go to jail nothing or die with nothing to  lose i i have a full security team with me everywhere i go how many rollers i'm strapped i have like four or five guys usually i'm strapped everywhere i go where possible like i don't i really don't like the idea of having to hit people unless i really have to hit people because you're talking about fighting and violence how many people can't fight you can get a guy who can't fight in an suv who sees you on the sidewalk and just thinks  this guy laurel it's a dangerous world and even now especially like in london i know boys who have had who've been pack stabbed when four dudes roll up with blades and jump you man just  you're dying man you're dying you only takes one  wound i know krav maga you don't know  you ain't steven seagal you are dying it doesn't matter you know to kick box box amir khan got robbed for his watch  x world champion they're  right up on him took his watch off him two weeks ago well they do they pull a  sword four of them give me it what the  you're doing that'd be the worst feeling getting your watch robbed yeah it happens that's what happens a lot so london's crazy no it to me i saw whoa what happens in miami a lot i know really london's nuts now man and and london is a  now or whatever bro  google anyone here sitting here google london stabbing and click on the news tab stab stab every day and they and they they they stab first they don't come up and say give me the watch they come up and stab you and you're like what the  you start bleeding out and then they take off your corpse they don't give a  bro it is crazy in london london you know i need a full i have a full security i do not call walk the streets another i do not wear a watch i have a full security team everything it's london's getting bad bad and it's not just even the nice areas you can go to the knightsbridge mayfair they'll get your ass just the same there's people in london who just don't give a  anymore and this is yeah it's getting crazy and then and the americans say well this is why we need guns to defend ourselves well not really because then they'd have guns so now like it's a mentality thing the mentality of people is dangerous it's a hard it's a hard heart that kills you you have to be really about it this is what most people don't understand people who play gangster and play tough guy don't understand that you don't really want to play that game because you're going to play a game with people who aren't playing yeah a true hard heart is different there are people if they want someone dead he's going to  die they don't care daylight broad daylight his wife his kid they don't give a  and they'll do the time these people exist they're all over the  news you really want to walk around playing gangster with people like that out there in the world you want to learn to box and say oh i can defend myself now you can't defend yourself for  i defend myself with large walls a bunch of weapons and being hard to access that's how you defend yourself you do not defend yourself thinking i can kick box let me run around the streets and and there are people who still do it but i think the world's on a decline i think the western world is getting worse i don't think it's getting any better i think all the problems we're seeing now are going to be 10x 20x 30x as people get  hungry across the next 10 20 years and i think if you don't have a plan to defend yourself or at least move to a place where you don't need to defend yourself in real time people are going to start getting  up what do you think's about to happen just complete anarchy i don't think it's gonna be complete anarchy but there's gonna be a lot of crime there's gonna be a massive polarization the polarization already exists right in western nations there's already a polarization because there's no longer any morality which is built into the populace i live in a poor country i live in romania which is technically poor it's one of the poorest countries in europe it's very very poor the average wage is like 400 bucks a month the police drive dachio logan's the police drive cars that can't even go above 70 miles an hour i've never seen a police chase when the police thought me i say why don't people run we just outrun you he goes oh well you know why why run when you can just get ticket it's very much people the police force isn't heavily armed like none of this  but it's safe in general unless you piss off a big guy the crime is very organized there's no random crime it's very organized crime organized crime keeps society functioning organized crime is very very functioning functional i would rather live in a country with organized crime than nonorganized crime unorganized crime like london no but unorganized crime like london is wrong place wrong time get stabbed take your watch organized crime is uh you have to go and make an enemy you have to piss someone off and you usually get a warning so unless you're a  jackass you'll be fine it's only if you want to go into industries which are competing with them or if you want to like do something they don't like i know that a lot of the gangsters in certain towns in romania keep the drugs out the towns are drugs free people try to sell drugs they're the ones who died so there's no drugs on the streets because they don't like drugs because their children go to school so you have drug free cities american police can't get a city drug free but the mafia will they have to see you drug free because they catch anyone  selling that  they're  disappearing so organized crime can actually be pretty good for a society because as long as you don't piss these people off now americans are the worst on the planet for this americans have basically no social awareness and they're jackasses with big mouths so an american we might go to a place like romania and get drunk hey bro man bro man i do what i want bro they're gonna get  up right but if you're if you're a person with a brain and you're like you know what this is not my territory sorry really sorry you're never gonna have any trouble so organized crime is a good thing so romania is a very very poor country a lot of organized crime but in general it's extremely safe girls walk alone at night all in the middle of parks three in the morning through a park you'll see some hot beautiful chick just walking through the park and and i said to people like isn't she scared like what if someone were to attack her or whatever and they said no she's a romanian girl like a romanian man would not hurt a romanian girl there's like a unity there's a morality romania is the most christian country in the world it's like there's a common sense of morality right so they would never just hurt someone random because they see themselves in them americans america doesn't have that no america has none of that but america is more diverse too right more diverse which is why when you look into it and hey bro i'm brown i'm half i'm half black half white my father is africanamerican so we talk about diversity i'm not saying it from a racist standpoint i'm saying the reason it's propagated by the matrix is because it divides society which is what they want as we discussed earlier which we can go into another point but i don't want to get the podcast but but i'm just saying that when you live in a homogenous site like romania where 999 people are romanian they see themselves in other people so when the country goes broke because it's already broke now the country's poor crime doesn't escalate america is a different story as soon as america starts running out of money and people start getting broke in america it's it's a freeforall as soon as people start can't i can't eat look at the looting i've never seen looting in romania no one's ever looted a store none of this  in the riots romania had huge political protests because they one of their uh presidents got called stealing billions massive protests you can google up like you've never seen bigger than blm huge not single store looted not one why because that's some family store there's morality left that looting  was  up bro there's no crack so you're saying what's gonna happen i'm saying in the western world we're not without morality the only thing that keeps people in line is fear of the law the second that's gone you better get out of jet jee it's going to be a   i think some crazy shit's about to go down like that i'm sure if it does go down can we bunk up with you or i i have got food for 10 years in my house you got guards i've got food for 10 years and bullets for a long fire fight so and four wives more than that g come on i haven't settled down yet but um but uh yeah i think i think yeah and it's interesting like people we can talk about a whole bunch of  but when you're talking about wealth and money and stuff the rich truly understand this the wealth the the wealthy of the world are starting to understand this americans are actually a very unique type of people because i am american as well so when i say these things i'm not hating on americans because i'm american right but americans are unique because like when americans make a bunch of money it doesn't really cross their mind to leave america the the the psyop the most the most free country we're the freest free to do what gee what are you more free to do like how about this i'll go drive 200 miles an hour in my lambo in romania and you drive 200 miles per hour on your lambo in america unless you get some more trouble what are you free you can't even drive faster well probably free of than china or something freer than china who's not freer than china yeah well i mean like but i'm saying that there's mostly you go to portugal whatever the  you want so but but i'm saying the psyop is so large on the american populace that a lot of the money still stays inside of america but in other countries people are more more open and agile but i think as the internet comes as people start to realize wait i'm an american i'm earning x amount of money i'm i want to move to miami or i can move to croatia i think there's a lot of good people in america though but there's a lot of idiots completely i'm not hating on americans i'm saying that when the wealth of america starts realizing that their money will get them further they will be safer and have a better quality of life outside of the usa that's the problem for the usa i'm not hating on the people yeah i'm saying that the american mindset is still america america america everywhere else is dangerous and poor but americans haven't traveled much per percent of the population but once they realize there's other options all americans would be like wait instead of 10 grand a month in miami i could spend a grand a month in croatia hotter women zero crime better like the weather's just good croatia badass man in miami miami has a lot of hot girls but okay let me change it from horror let me change it to better quality okay here they go to church they're innocent you can show them the world you know you always showed a bit yeah they have like one body yeah that's for us three fifties like three yeah but that's my point you're talking about what's gonna happen i think that as as as as wealth starts to flee the west there's gonna be serious issues that's why there's gonna happen that's scary   bro but i might be wrong who knows i'm surprised i just feel some crazy shit's coming like people are just getting more and more and divided the government's getting crazier and crazier everything's  but they polarize us on purpose like i i i'm not gonna i think it's gonna come to a complete crash and it's going to take a total reset for humanity to ever get back to true but the problem is the total the total reset i have no idea the total in our lifetime but this is the problem to whoever is powerful enough to construct a total reset we'll construct it in a way that we have even less freedom than we've ever had true that's what the that's what the reset's for they're trying to destroy it all for the reset so they can come along and say the only way we can keep you safe the only way you are safe is if you obey let me give you guys some examples some first of all that's 100 let me give you some examples right because once the the only thing that's preventing a huge reset right now is a human element the human element is the one thing that they're combating against so we were talking earlier about what do you mean by the human element right we're talking about kids going to school and the mother involved and and the human ideas the human element so let's give an example the last three years there was a pandemic blah blah they made all these crazy rules the rules only exist if the police enforce them and during the pandemic i traveled the entire world i never stayed still for a second i managed to get in and out of every country i wanted to i did whatever the  i wanted so sweden never locked down they don't want to talk about that they don't talk about the fact that in stockholm in nightclubs it was full of chicks and it was completely  normal without max this whole time the entire  time so i'm in stockholm for three months right so you can go stockholm go from country country whatever the country where the police forces are more professional more inside of the matrix had stricter covert rules than the countries where the police are more corrupt and more lazy because you can't force it so if i was in serbia and didn't wear a mask and a police over there comes that mask i said bros is stupid i don't wear a mask okay he doesn't he doesn't get paid enough he doesn't care american cop you better put it on bro like so the the police force the more matrixminded they are the more strict the society is going to be and i'm saying the human element because there are certain laws that they'd love to make but they can't make because they're too far for the police even in completely controlled countries western countries to enforce if they were to say to the american police kill everyone with the long hair they would the police wouldn't do it right but the human element is being removed this is what i'm trying to say all this  with electric cars and ai and all stuff all this stuff wait until the police are robots wait till they bring on the new coveted  and there's no human element in the enforcement wait till it's  pure robotic when they program the robots if they ain't got a mask on take him out they won't give a  there's not gonna be that's a grandma without a mask it's not gonna be oh that's my brother that man it's not gonna be you know what this pandemic's gone on too long this guy doesn't have a mask on it's not gonna be ah he's asthmatic there are certain things you could even as stupid as the police were during this thing because the police proved themselves to be  retards as stupid as they were you could still reason with them maybe not america but in many places in the world you could say gee i'm not wearing a  mask it's a wedding i want a wedding photo and they'd be like okay like in many places the world kobe wasn't really that real because the police didn't really enforce it because it was stupid once it goes robotic then you're that's the great reset and here you know how they're going to do it they're doing the guys of safety they're going to come along and say all these accidental shootings by human cops accidentally killing people we can't trust police officers as people because we're all flawed a machine never makes a mistake you're going to be safe with the machine cops don't worry machine cops come along when the machine cops have replaced us all then the enslavement we're a long ways away from that we're okay then let's take electric cars electric cars is the same deal electric cars the same thing they want us all to have electric cars because they can turn your car off that's all the reason they want to have one they can turn it off they can't turn off your combustion engine but they can turn off your  electric car so they're forcing us all to have them why the environment though here we go let's talk about that talk about that  they want electric cars so they can stop you moving so this whole point of it you think they give a solitary  about the environment you said environment the amount of lithium they're digging up to make these batteries it's doing more damage to the environment than a  petrol engine could ever do you're telling me about the environment and these people are so scared about climate change but then the second they get they're just doing it because it makes money though because people will buy something to feel environmentally friendly what i'm saying i don't think elon musk sitting there thinking oh i want to turn people's cars off he's thinking people are going to buy electric cars to save the environment and i'm going to make  correct but the people who are in charge of the world are going to propagate yeah they're going to get behind they're going to propagate it and report it under the guise of control because that's all they're interested in controlling it then too it's not no i think elon's i actually believe he loans a relatively good guy just making a good product the point i'm trying to make is this the way they're going to make us because if elon was a good guy making a good product fine but why are they going to force us to have electric cars because it's coming already in europe you can't sell diesel cars after 2026 really yeah they're stopping look it up  you can only buy electric cars within 10 years no no they they don't care about so yeah that's crazy yeah but then every every manufacturer's just gonna uh start to make electric cars correct so all the so not by elon because all the manufacturers make electric cars right america the reason america is delayed in this because america a lot of the lobbying to the government is done by oil companies that's also why america doesn't have rail you ever wondered why america as big as it is doesn't have bullet trains like what like bullet trains like china or japan they have bullet trains they have 300 mile per hour trains that are never late for an even a single second america would be perfect for that but they don't have it because big oil comes along lobbies the government make sure all the rail projects are shut down so you have to drive your ass on the freeway on these huge freeways which is good for for the oil companies for the gasoline so that's a side note so that's why it's delayed in america because the big oil is involved but if you look at europe most european countries are already starting to say you have to have electric cars you can only buy you can still drive your petrol car but you have to buy an electric car or a hybrid by 2026 lamborghini's just gone hybrid aston martin's new car is a hybrid even the supercar companies are going hybrid because they know they're gonna have to right and they're doing this they're doing this they're doing this under the guise of climate change what did i say earlier about trojan horse we care about the how we care about the planet climate change climate change climate change climate change the trojan horse inside of that is we're going to control you we're going to stop you eating as much meat we're going to stop you flying around on planes you're going to have to have an electric car that we can control we know exactly where it goes we can turn it off we're going to stop you doing xyz for the environment but the people are in charge of the world who purport this  are they flying on economy planes are they flying on jets jets they're flying on jets when they get rich and they're so scared about sea levels they buy a nice big mansion on the water you ever notice a hat dude oh i thought the sea was coming but you want a  mansion on the beach you're not very scared of it now are you and they'll also have armed guards and say that people can't have them have guns so this is what i'm saying all of these things that the matrix reports it's all   because the people who are actually  involved in purporting it are not concerned by it on any level and they're gonna come along to you and say for the environment don't eat meat drive your electric car on tuesday it's the only day it's gonna turn on  you you're a peasant you're a slave you're a peon that's what you are and that's what you'll be if you try and go to the protest about being a slave we will shut your electric car off  you okay slavery's coming and if you resist too much the kill bots are going to turn to your house  drag you to gulag center number seven that's the future of humanity we're living one of the last free times yeah it's okay it's coming mind  yeah well should we wrap andrew say you're the  man yeah you're the man thank you this is great this was by far how long was this voice like

took it easy did you guys lose power no no i think like we lost power well so i guess like my section of jersey city yesterday yeah like a whole strip had lost power and i was in the office because we had shot yeah fullsize run which is out now with bianca belair wwe raw women's champion was your beep super beeper i know i know i don't have a beeper no no no no no but i don't want it emergency services out i did get hit asking if i could like because i'm the only one who has a key to the basement saying if i could go down there and like look at the breaker well i had i was that's what i'm saying i was here and i was like hey i can be home in like an hour and a half your professional life takes precedent over the safety and the comfort of your tenants yeah do you have a chief of staff just what kind of look do you have somebody to delegate to you i mean there's like there's like someone yeah there's someone else in the building that like if i wasn't there like if you had to be like hey can you like put this out or something like that that could take care of it but i'm the only one with the keys to the basement how hot was it yesterday yesterday wasn't as bad was it or was it today now the one that wasn't as bad as don't tell us 87 and the power is out for an hour and a half  all right go home and fix it it by the time i got home it was already the power was already back on it was out for an hour and a half okay do you think some food went bad in some fridges or anything like that was this your first real test though no what was your first real test as a superintendent the first real test was when my next sword neighbor's water heat i think i suppose the water heater broke do we hear about this i don't know and like it ripped through like wow it like ripped through like this it was on the second floor and just like all of a sudden it was like dripping some duct tape on there no it was dripping in the hallway but like completely like but it also set off every single smoke alarm oh man in the building at once because it hit like a tripwire or something like that and you had you trained for that no i had no clue what i'm doing and i'm like it was like a panic attack set in and i had to like rip out every single smoke alarm in the building which was like 12 of them this to me like the box jumps are almost training for that right just working on your vertical dude i had that i actually had this macgyver i had to take the rogue box and flip it up to the 30 inch set you used your crossfit equipment to rip out the smoke alarms that's amazing wow that's just being handy i feel like we need that as a commercial for some noble sneakers or something yeah it was dude it was i'll be on you that was like that's scary no it was like it was just a stressful situation you know what i mean so and i was just it was it was a pain in the ass but you learned how to handle the stress because yesterday while the power was out for an hour and a half and your whole building was cooking you you weren't even thinking about it yeah i was still flipping yeah i was thinking about i was thinking about flipping skipping about giving everyone watching this the content they've been so dying don't say i never did anything for them the content they've been dying to see don't worry it's like this us i was talking about what  restaurant right the one thing that we should the one thing we should talk about the content they really want to hear is the story came out i know people hate hearing about things in the slack but we are reminiscing upon childhood era uh high fructose corn syrup drinks right yeah because the chocolate tacos continue yeah and you know i mentioned it i mentioned it the watermelon roll also got discontinued this summer so we went but we went down the beverage lane yesterday we started talking about you know orangina frootopia orangina i still have never had i don't i don't i have never had an orange either sips though sips i i threw in sips basically orange jean is like it's like carbonated orange juice and you were big on that it's just one of those drinks that um you know because they're not going to serve you straight up soda in uh high school or whatever there's like one soda machine on the far side in the vocational school so it was like orange juice with carbonation so it kind of like skidded close enough yeah skidded the line of like not soda but kind of soda were you all ever sobe drinkers no remember the lizard yeah but it was that drink was trash yeah but it was a cool logo damascus he was in graphic design he was into the graphic design the bottles like that's nothing but the one just what about orbits remember orbits you have the little plastic beads in it yeah i never had those but it was always fun to look the one you ever have jolt cola yes yeah the one the one drink that we ended up uh reminiscing upon a bit was your mom or your grandmother making you the homemade iced tea without the powder oh yeah i can't relate to this but y'all worried yeah it was like in the plastic jar and like a cooler full of it you go into the fridge so good too really good but joe put it out there that he used to dry scoop the powder from the iced tea when he said he was feeling a little uh feel a little restless you could buy the handful you can buy this you take the actual and just like put it on his tongue it wasn't bad it wasn't that bad it's just it's a different color behavior it's not normal behavior but it's a different kind of sugar when you're young and yeah i would would you get in trouble for that did your mom ever catch you i mean they knew it because i was bouncing off the walls because there was like wet you know how like that's that uh the powder like crystallizes when it gets wet yeah if there's like a wet scoop like a wet rim around the listen just a summer summer a summer scoop i used to call it a summer scoop and yeah maybe powdered iced tea maybe on those on those nights i was a little more hyperactive than usual yeah it was the focus you needed to get your precalc homework done exactly way before that but yeah maybe long division that actually reminds me that reminds me this is somewhat related in terms of artificial flavor to to boost meals up we used to hang out at my friend glenn's house after school and his grandma was mostly running the show in that in that era his mom was out doing whatever she was doing and uh she used to make spaghetti with ketchup no um the spaghetti was just ramen noodles packets without the ramen without the without the flavoring no just just the noodles she would just boil up the noodles and there was some cupboard in his house stashed with you know 78 ramen noodles flavored packets from over the years that were never used because she was always making noodles was it was did she like dub it ramen noodles or was like oh you're having pasta it was pasta it was like spaghetti and now you're at emilio's look at the progression wow yeah not there as often as our friend matt welty but i've been there once and what one other beverage i want to mention that we did yeah this is the content people are looking for definitely squeeze it yes squeeze it's an absolute classic they had like the ad where it was like the boxer you know yeah yeah yeah yeah but just the feeling that that tactile sensation of twist twisting pop off and then just just squeeze yeah i i used to take one scoop of the uh powdered sugar iced tea and then scoop off and then uh twist off the squeezes and sometimes i would just yank to squeeze it too too hard because i was that excited sugar high you were you were doubling up yeah no joe was literally dusted yeah what an error huh yeah what a time now look we're on a sneakers podcast 13 minutes in i haven't mentioned one one sneaker we didn't we didn't talk about one shoe yet no not one should we give away a pair of shoes already or should we talk about the suits we have a fear should we just talk about the shoes we have on feet then give away the shoes and then get into them okay we're here for they're gonna run the show people aren't here for this what do you wear wealthy i love this uh these are a shoe that i think like most of us you forget that you have in the stash especially when it's a little bit older um i forgot i had these i've only worn these like twice these i never knew you had these beautiful shoes what did i i think these are the meda those are the root beer floats mt 580s i think they're from like 2013 2014 something like that really are they that late yeah it's not um one of the og ones i think this may this is one of the revlite 580s so oh okay it's not um i'm sorry i keep interrupting you but i didn't know that was a revlite one yeah but i think a lot of the revlite shoes were very bad i feel like yeah but these are i feel like i'm okay with it okay social status penny ones and you're doing two different colors yeah so i'm playing around with the swooshes a little bit a little arts and crafts yeah it comes with what like four closeup in case you don't have i wish you could i don't i don't know if the mic picked up on that but you were ripping the the swoosh off the velcro like you gotta hold this can you hold the shoe up to the mic so the listeners can get the real who did it better who who ripped the velcro swoosh off the shoe better wait what was the show or who he you don't remember it's one of the most infamous moments of the show oh yeah the the dunks the canary there we go pretty good that's that's about as satisfying as twisting the top off of squeezing what is it you throwing the socks jill these are the lap stone hammered dyed socks you didn't bring the dad socks no side socks not dad sucks dad socks these are lap stone hammers they died shouts to brian shout out brian yeah this was a this was a midday change because i caught i said a double header at the beginning of the show it's let me just say it's wwe week here at complex little hint yeah bianca bel air will be out friday yeah and then maybe monday you may see something all right that's all i'm given all right live once i'm doing my left new balance 993 so this is kind of my new version of the dirty reebok workout in terms of just the sneaker that i pull out every day okay listen he seems very excited he made sure he made sure this week that he he thought about his choice he just said he pulled out the everydays it happens you know what you are 16 minutes in listen i feel like it's good that we could have like a wideranging topic podcast because we've been giving you some serious sneaker talking the past few weeks yeah so this isn't serious sneaker talk no this is all about childhood drinks and um what we ate for dinner city restaurants not so much invited yeah but go binge go binge the last few episodes i've been bangers humbly as as will this one be i have a feeling absolutely should we give away some sneakers then now it's time okay it's time what is what is that bruce buffer oh boxing right ufc sorry so close i'm sorry his brother his brother actually they're they're half brothers and they didn't discover that they were like brothers until like later in life i believe and they had already gone down that professional road of being announcers i'm not sure but they both ended up in this doing the same thing which i think is just super fascinating incredible stuff every week here on the show we give away a free pair of sneakers with the people at ebay sneakers you can enter to win a pair of sneakers by going to ebaycomplexcom and submitting a question for us to respond to here on the air if we pick your question if we answer your question if we address it we are going to send you a free pair of sneakers courtesy of the good people at ebay and their sneakers authenticity guarantee program only open to us residents i think we have a pair of nike sb dunks here today oh yes we do we've been doing a lot of dunks lately right yeah i might as well this is a this is a nostalgic shoe for me i want to hear you're happy we're giving this one i want to hear all about it okay should we should we say who they're going to first hear my story absolutely i've probably told the story about these before this week's ebay sneaker question of the week comes from john mcchesney lexington kentucky shouts to joe joe from oneness jack harlow jackie yep what was the first sneaker you saved up money for how could we remember that actually you remember it no no correct because someone actually gave a  for that once zach harlow is not from lexington he's from louisville oh i don't know i've never been to kentucky okay i'm sorry we said that on here or i probably think so i think we had mentioned it once in someone we got the l's mixed up dave matthews good thing dave matthews is not in studio we'll make a note of that but do you want to tell your story first do we want to answer the question first whatever i don't want to be selfish can we say the question or we already did oh sorry got emilio's on the break all right all right all right let me let me talk about this  yeah this one here we're giving away nike sb dunklow green tokyo taxi remember the blue pair as well blue pair better than kind of like the hair but you think so i think so personally i kind of like remember those shoes and i remember being i wanting the blue pair more than the green important thank you you bet yeah it is kind of a low key ducks colorway right yeah i think it's a high key ducks colorway okay we'll take that we are giving these away this is a nostalgic sneaker for me this is from the era when we first got into dunks in high school i feel like oh six all my friends and me just just trying to buy whatever we could and i remember my friend adam holbert one of my dearest friends i was the best man at his wedding actually you know i'm often the best man in the world okay i gave a good speech is that a question did you that's not a question okay i did um he had a pair of these for so long that got so destroyed that all the stuffing was coming out of the collar and eventually there was a family of spiders living in there you know because it's disgusting no um no i don't think adam ever really skated like that but definitely took him up and down mountains across continents imagine like every single person's house that he visits he like drops off an infestation like a wow looks like a bug in there like apartment would you let him into the apartment complex and he came through stringent super if there ever was one okay it's where you draw the line hour and a half no power like the next things you know you have like bed bugs or something in the park i'm kidding okay go ahead so that is that is what i you know the person getting these sneakers from ebay they're getting a brand new ds pair but the vision of them in my mind will always be with a corroded innard and spider those come with the i'm not sure if both pairs come with the gloves is it just the blue pair do both pairs come with the gloves i don't remember well they they're please let us know they came with the the driving gloves yeah yeah because it's inspired by taxis wasn't there a third pair um i think there was there was a third pair i think there was two i think there was no i think there was the green dunks right there blue dunks and i looked i want to say there was a black and yellow nike sb team edition that was also part of the pack he went deep i think so that a boy deeper than a family of spiders i can still remember like where i was like being in the skate shop where we're seeing i passed something i passed on those but it was one i'm sorry no no no no no uh but you brought up skate shops definitely in the skate shop remember like seeing it on the wall probably going like this scratching your chin trying to put the fit together in your mind i ultimately passed but it was a close but also like you you didn't want to like i remember back then you kind of had to decide which shoe you wanted first because at least for me i'd always get you'd get your hopes up that you wanted the one shoe but like the odds of them actually still having that shoe in your size or like a dice roll the one two not being this one being a better nike has be done or just in general like if you were like hey do i want this one but then you didn't even want to ask for sometimes you didn't want to ask for it because are you kidding they don't have them in the size yeah yeah but then a lot of them did and it was like you know you always hear oh we used to love when we would go into a store and they were but the skate shops like around this era yeah still had that sometimes just like the jrod where it was in the window i was like there's no way that there's a jumpman on the tongue of that p rod and it's still in my size and i walked in and they had it this this was like still right around there now you're saying this wasn't good enough for you for me it was always like they're always like are you kidding me we only have a size eight left yeah you know just kick rocks not kick rocks but you just like yeah you felt a little like foolish even asking that you think that they would still have it you know yeah i know what you mean so the ebay question was the first sneaker you saved up money to get yeah i don't remember my first i don't remember my actual first i never forget the first that's also true i don't remember my first but i do remember stashing money away for a pair that i really wanted and it wasn't a onetoone stash away there were some complications was this the jordan 17 yes so i told it is it okay if i tell it again yeah i mean if it's the if it's the answer we got a lot of episodes people haven't necessarily heard it we're going to see dave matthews in pennsylvania dave matthews band not the producer of complex not the producer so that's a nick full circle moment and i had a sprint flip phone it was right around when the internet like you could go on the internet on the phone and i was like wow i could like where were the websites you were frequenting i don't know i don't know uh i definitely told this story before long story short it's a good story texting the girlfriend at the time yeah welty could tell back in the day when the texting counted as like internet it wasn't unlimited texting yeah you had to like log on the internet and then you could text and joe mr won't divulge his screen time lipuma was on there heavy yeah five hours of texting on the way there and i think i even like took a nap for an hour and left the internet on the phone bill was eight hundred dollars and it was around the same in the same like span of two weeks when the jordan 17s the white and reds because i got the white and blue and i think i got the black but the white and reds the white and red i was working on a finish line at the time and i remember of course you were i remember the phone bill was crazy and like my parents had to help out yeah with the phone bill at that time do you steal my money from your mother i took it i took it back what do you mean you took it back well i was just my parents said you have to pay me back for the phone bill 800 and i was like every check 100 here 300 garnish and then the white and red 17s came out and i took the money back to get to get you know some countries they'll cut your hand off for that you took the money out of nowhere right in the cabinet exactly right in the cabinet did it take you a while to get to the point of you're like i'm going to steal from my parents in order to afford the shoes or if you just knew that it had to happen it wasn't stealing from my parents it was stealing from paying back you're like stealing back the money that was already yes yes that i knew i would pay the robin hood  i love the total loan shark the loan like mental gymnastics that you're going through to justify the fact that you still from your parents yeah but it's you guys are painting it out like i went into the pocketbook i didn't did you tell your mom you were taking the money no but i was kidding you stole it no but i was taking the money from my check and putting it i was like oh yeah i'm putting it it's not like they were waiting it was absconding with the goods like a younger joe lapuma dipping into the sweet tea powder and then and then they found out and what was the punishment i didn't return the shoes no hair gel for three months it wasn't a good day huh you know what no hair gel for three months so yeah but i just remember i remember being like i'm going to get in trouble but they're going to sell out i need them did the salt did the sauce the sauce spoon make uh no no they got the wooden spoon yeah they're all up to you with this food they used to dish the gravy out but that that was one where i remember and i only remember that because i just remember like a roll of cash hit like and you knew exactly where it was yeah and hit and and i was doing it like they trusted me that i was gonna do it they probably shouldn't have but like that i was gonna keep adding and adding to the pot and then i took yeah it took like what it must have been with the discount 200 something did you pay that money back yes yes okay that's why i could talk about it now but i just remember that's why you can talk about it is it bad i would have never done that would you have left the phone on i had a similar experience like that where i think it was it was around the time when my little brother first had a phone probably 2008 and i had come back from europe well traveled yeah i was going to dave matthews band in pennsylvania you're going from europe all right and there was a young woman who i wanted to be in frequent contact with at the time similar situation yeah and i definitely just was texting her all the time for my little brother's phone because i didn't have a phone yet you know i hadn't owned a cell phone at that point and definitely racked up some serious charges that's what happened i thought you were going to say like luckily you grew up in an area that didn't have like frequent cell service so you couldn't he likes to he likes to add on the story i mean definitely it was the cell service was hard to come by but yeah i paid the money back so it's all good good and i got the white and red 17 good good good i think the shoe that i first saved up for and i've i think mentioned these on here before and i wish i could find back in my email i saw emails from decades ago how much i paid but it was this pair of error sb dunks nike sb dunklow that turned out to be fake when um there was a store in spokane washington it was like the first resell shop at the time and the the guy you know he's like you guys have heard of flight club and we were like oh what's that you know it's kind of my first exposure to things like that and is that why you hate spokane washington so much no there's plenty of reasons to hate spokane washington summertime in the 509 is not one of a classic song same with hoops fest um i remember going to the shop for the first time and he had a bunch of air force ones and that was really cool i got one of the philly pairs of air force ones but i wanted a pair of sb dunks and that was a big deal to me to be able to get when i said what about this pair can you help me find this pair and he said yeah but you know it's going to cost some money and yeah i think maybe he charged me like 250 or 300 which back then was a huge amount and i just always had the sneaking suspicion that they were fake and eventually kind of just came to the conclusion myself that they were but but you saved up for them yeah i didn't steal from my  parents how much were you putting aside each i i really don't know didn't take out of the pot of gold for the shoes yeah i i did eventually replace them though with a real pair just just so that people know about my resume well what about you what was the first pair of sneakers you said first thing i ever saved up for i remember wasn't a pair of sneakers was a pair of tommy hilfiger carpenter jeans but okay with the little thing on it yeah yeah yeah that was um right yeah yeah the hammer on you no um that was a that was the first thing but i would say probably like the first thing was like i think the first time i had to like purchase my own shoes was probably like when i was like 18 19 like right out of high school like my parents were not buying or i wanted more shoes than like cool shoes too yeah yeah or like more than the just the getting the shoes at the start of the year you know christmas maybe summertime you know like the traditional like spots where you get a pair of shoes i think it was um just going to like the finish line in the mall there was a foot there's always a foot locker there that's what i used to work at but there was a brief period where there was also a finish line in the mall and finish line carried different stuff than foot locker and i think i bought like a pair of like early like adidas zx shoes and a pair of stan smiths that was like about it nothing super crazy but you were stashing away in the piggy bank for a long time for that one uh no i think i just actually had a job and could just actually what was the job uh working at a gas station okay so it wasn't too uh you were pumping gas or what no um you were flipping over the jalapeno poppers under the heat lamp once they were out in new hampshire let's get the other side of this hot dog all brown new hampshire is one of those uh states where you can selfservice at the pump so you don't know oh sure you don't have to pump gas like most states so yeah yeah but not jersey and oregon oh interesting enough uh what were you doing at the gas station this is what people want to know yeah more so more so it was more so just being like a convenience store cashier selling scratches yeah scratch off cigarettes beer all that stuff were you blowing a bunch of your checks on the scratches no no i've never i've never been a big gambling guy never been a big uh scratchoff person joe gambling scratches no i love me some  two inches yeah you walk around with like i know you got like the buttonup shirt right now you ever walk are you with like them in the pocket yeah that'd be cool right is that like a is that considered an acceptable gift that's the only thing you give someone because people do that because some people could hit big but also it could just be like nothing and it's like wow thanks that's no stan smith autograph card that's for sure and it wasn't even an occasion when you gave that to wilton i know other than being a couple weeks removed from my birthday still i'm still waiting on on yours i have a question just to put a pin in the parent situation how many new balance 623s so i have to buy my dad to write that uh you're gonna have to max out the kirkland card baby you're gonna have to you're gonna have to have a spenco already preloaded no because i'm up to at least four or five and a month yes mom stan smith dad new balance 623 does he know that exact model and like that's exactly what he wants now when i tell you the only i tried to get him the monarchs and i also tried to get him the what was like the cool monarch yeah yeah martine rose no no no no no no the m2k yes oh yeah and it was only new balance 623 and now they're doing like a gray suede colorway a navy blue he just undies the navy blue one so he's into the different colorways he's into the different colorways didn't didn't catch you guys all off guard like that brief moment when like wearing the white and navy monarchs became like unironically cool or whatever they did pete carroll's special yeah i know that a little bit but there was like that like 2017 2018 like period where like people were actually just like wearing monarchs like not yeah whatever yeah it was unsettling for me definitely i don't like that i think i remember i think that shoe belongs to a certain demographic you know i think at one point remember i i don't this isn't shade but remember that one point where we had like no it is no no we had that program where it was like an nfl player was like our intern at the office yeah yeah tony louise really good friend so when brennan scarlett was our intern for i think a summer he was with the texans now i think he's with the dolphins yeah shouts to brennan yes and he came in because he wore like size like 15 sneakers or whatever and that was the period where like monarchs had like become cool or whatever and this guy sitting next to me in the office wearing size 15 monarchs for someone you would never expect 4e to wear like the white navy monarchs with like skinny jeans like rolled up at the ankle and i'm just like wow people are really doing this right now and i guess they were so random question do you know what the 623 model is without looking at it i'm pretty sure i know it's pretty impressive i think i know who designed that actually really yeah i think this guy jonathan bacon who worked on the 992 i will double check that i interviewed him a while ago pretty good well do you ever buy your parents sneakers uh yeah all the time really damn i gotta am i  up i used to buy my mom's shoes especially when i worked at foot locker all the time like whatever like the top end like like air max 2009's like multiple pairs and she was into them uh yeah like asics like kyanos all that stuff you know what another thing i want to talk about how native shoes have cornered the kids market native shoes do you know those shoes yeah did travy mccoy wore a pair on uh it's a specific model okay like the holes in them i haven't heard anybody talk about natives wore the boots on long island young kids that's all they wear well i mean the whole foam shoes is like the thing now right i'm trying to find it i'm interested to see like what they do in sales i mean every single kid has them trying to find my guys my guy's resume we're all over the place right now that's okay hold on hold on hold on hold on these right here the kids his name is jonathan bacon i just said yes yeah yeah really all over contested mother approved yeah i had no idea all right so listen jonathan mcchesney mmhmm getting great pair great story checking for spiders no just kidding if they came from ebay you don't have to worry about that hopefully you have better luck than dunn's friend they hit him with can a raid before you some other sneaker news okay other than your dad's new mounds collection yeah those travis lowe's moving did you get a pair i didn't get a pair did you want a pair were you asking no i didn't call in any favors no i didn't the shoe was hotly debated within our coworkers it's a really good shoe though yeah and where do we you know i think we did a couple months ago we did the best and worst travis scots but i feel like this is just or just ranking the travis yeah yeah but i feel like this is in the upper echelon of travis did you do that on purpose no i didn't i didn't i think it's just tough i think don't even ask me how i didn't though i think it's tough to like really figure out like where this shoe lies within travis's sneaker legacy at least at this point right like the shirt travis scott air jordan one lower versus mocha yes because the shoe just released yeah the past week you know most people who probably hit don't even have their pairs yet you know so we're trying to rank where does the shoe stand in travis's catalog right obviously travis has done a lot of shoes that had a lot of impact on the sneaker space in some shoes that didn't have any impact right but a lot of those shoes like especially with travis going away for a while you know have had their time to kind of like sit in and sink and you know exactly what those shoes mean to like yeah a few years later not just travis's like legacy but just sneakers in general right like what their impact was like where like say like a shoot two shoes drop right they say like the highs and the lows drop or something like that and you're like it's been long enough we've been able to suss out for the most part like which one is the more like coveted of yeah which one has more staying power yeah but when the shoe just came out and people are like oh i really like this one but it's only been a week since it's been released is it really like can you we're hesitant to say that it's like the best i'm trying i'm not saying i guess because it's a jordan one low it jordan won low soccer but i'm not no because i like the travis jordan one lows but it's just hard to say what the shoes final impact is at this point it would be like you know you're rating an artist catalog and the new album comes out you're like oh i really love this album the first week you heard it but then a year later you're like dude i don't listen to it anymore don't you think this one feels a little different though i do think it feels a little different i think like these are universally really liked yeah less people don't like them than other other tribes i mean like even something like the hiroshi fuji you know the fragment travis jordan ones where like to me the high was kind of a miss the low was cool and you know people had their opinions about that but the only i think it's a good shoe but the only thing i can take away from it is that it feels very much on trend okay like where travis had set all the trends this one feels more like a reaction like what a dunk well like the dunk but also like the whole like vintagey like uh distressed oh in terms of the kind of offwhite not the brand but the color like sale yellow pieces on the shoe yeah i don't know i don't i don't really see that it feels like a travis shoe you know the browns and the tans and stuff like that there's just something about it that like makes me think like when you look at all those like people on ig who kind of like i don't know who like recreate shoes and whatnot like this is something that i wouldn't be surprised if they had like oh people who are building their own shoes or doing the faux vintage thing you feel like this looks like a product of that yeah more than a product of taxes jack enterprises i feel like these feel bigger though and i don't think it's recently biased they do feel bigger to your point than the fragment lows and i think that yeah i think so i maybe it's because everyone just tried to get them and again it's fresh in our mind but i don't know i feel like this is this is a shoe that you don't hear many like these aren't good not a lot of doubters yeah it's just like i think because we were trying to debate it a bit in like the one shoe that like we were debating against which is i don't know it's so tough because i personally like them but like the fours see i i i didn't chime in in that debate i think the fours are great i'm not that big on the track i just think that was like the oilers yeah like our colleagues said that they didn't age well i think they aged fine i think that should i like that we had paul wall on fullsize run and i'm not like taking this into account but when i heard paul wall say like why that wasn't awesome yeah that means something for sure it kind of swayed me a little bit where i'm like there's a little more like behind this like him doing the oilers colorway yeah and i know that you're like oh we're only ranking the shoes that came out to the public but i do think that travis scott doing the four had some sort of impact on that moment in sneakers when like the jordan 4 became like the biggest flex shoe like a lot of friends and family pairs but that whole era of like you see like offset or quavo wearing like uh marquette or georgetown oh okay that's true special makeups like but the four became like i know there were a lot of fours yeah in the mix but i feel like travis's impact on the four definitely pushed that needle a little more too i guess one thing i'll say for that colorway is that it's one of the few ones in travis scott's nike or jordan work that actually has a theme to it or some type of decision inspiration yeah you know it's like oh there's a historical connection that this shoe is inspired by and i also think someone said oh well the friends and family took away from the general release now i do for the fours yeah the the the oilers ones yeah i do get that the friends and family ones are really really strong but i don't think it took away from that foreign from my strong like like general rules yeah and it was also the thing you have to give that shoe i think too was the fact that it was ah before no pun intended like all the other shoes for the most part what do you mean like all the other jordans all day they travis scott jordan yeah wasn't that the first one that released i don't remember that was his first one yeah okay check that out so it's like that's the one that like when that's you know it's weird because it's so different in a way people were like people like weren't sure how they felt about that shoe when it first released because like for a while you could get that shoe for like kind of cheap yeah yeah yeah three four hundred dollars definitely but then it kind of i think it kind of like skyrocketed a little bit yeah because people were like oh  travis scott jordans are a thing yeah because i remember that was very early on in the fullsize run days remember when trinidad had gotten a pair from stockx or it took forever to shoot there was some sort of stuff forever because he didn't buy it from ebay yeah there was some sort of snafu behind him buying that shoe and getting all that frustrated oh i didn't remember that detail sources said to you 24 million entries yep one source close to travis scott's team i don't i don't know what to do with that information yeah it's hard to gauge you don't know like so say uh you get like people get the sneakers notification on anything you know what i mean like air jordan one or panda yeah whatever yada yada dropping how many people do you think are hitting that raffle to enter on it tough to say it's tough to say but you would expect that a lot just a lot of people like who don't even have intentions of buying the shoe it's just anything sneakers related pops up on their phone you're hitting enter so you'd have to go back and look at the user base size for sneakers which we've published some of that data before but nike never really makes it public and then kind of how much engagement there is and they talk about how much demand percentage they serve in the app we have some of those figures i can't remember them off the top of my head but it wouldn't surprise me if like there were semisimilar numbers for just yeah for sure any random sneakers drop yeah it's not like oh 20 000 people entered for a sneakers drop you know like no i don't think that's ever happening you mentioned the panda done yeah you brought up the panda dunks are we past the panda hate what is it what is it i don't understand it i don't understand it either because you know why it's a good looking sneaker and it's such a basic like that's the point of the shoe it's a black and white nike dunk low how could you ever be mad at they're being a millionaire because it reminds me of that white nike dunk black and white cortez that you would wear i'm not saying that i think the whole thing is that there's no hate on the shoe itself if the shoe existed within a vacuum okay but it's more so people feel like what the shoe like represents within which is sneaker space where it's like the you know it's you see so many of them it's just like it's the next shoe to the dirty white air force one you know what i mean i don't know if i agree even my girlfriend does have a beat pair so watch out and  i don't agree i don't agree with that because they're not worn really beat a lot to me i'm not it's just a cul it's just like people hating on them also it's not a sacrilegious to me like the white one air force one is a thing where you keep it so clean and it's supposed to know i'm not i'm not the same but do you feel on the other side i mean culturally like like rinsed yes yeah i just feel like it's a perfect gr like goes with anything and this hate because it's been so widely released and it keeps restocking is just weird but it's become like the sneaker culture shoe for like people who aren't into sneaker culture people who want i don't know if they're they're saying they're into sneaker culture by where they're not but i mean but there's just like it's become like the de facto shoe to a lot of people that's where i feel like a lot of the hate stems for the shoe to me i look at it like a totally fine shoe to wear and also like i don't have a pair it's a little little white for me but too much white but also like i feel like if if i had to gift someone we always talk about like oh what's that would be the price i just feel the gift here it's a little obvious sometimes is that safe to say for sure like with all due respect and this is not a shot at all so don't take it this way but when you had finn on sneaker shopping and he's like i don't know what shoe to buy and then the girl working at the shops like you should buy panda dunks you know and it was like yeah sure i'll buy those you know and i like how he said no disrespect to you it's no oh of course like there's no like thought into like which shoes do you really like you just like the black and white dunk but isn't that refreshing yeah isn't that isn't there some sort of refreshing where it's like but like isn't it refreshing to maybe not have to always think and it's like a total i love shoes like that total like the one the one thing that i wouldn't say like ruined it for me but our good friend tommy battle this was like a year plus ago but he had made a comment where he said this shoe is fisher price my first dunks shout out to tommy he's killing it by the way yeah i'm not sure i agree with that but shout outs to tommy you see the photos he's taken i'm not mad at that comment but i like it for that that's what i'm saying i like it for that people can have an entry point you know it doesn't have to be the cause the thing is like i feel like you would be not i don't want to i don't want to necessarily paint you in this way but i feel like you might be upset if you saw that somebody's first pair of dunks was the super limited travis scott playstation you know it's like that's true i'm not like someone who's out there like getting super worked up about panda dunks okay you pose the question of why people are upset about this  that's also true and i'm literally saying to you i'm not putting this out there but there's a lot of people who are just like oh that's like the suburban white girls wearing the shoe and just rinsing it to the ground that's where like a lot of people see it seems at least their frustration from the panda dunk comes within sneaker culture where they're like this isn't going to be like and it's totally cool all those people are in the shoes i'm not throwing that out there i'm not saying this myself yeah it's just like you want to ask why people are upset about early at least make sure you think that's jokes about panda dunks that's the reason why people make jokes about panda dunks that's fine i think people can make jokes it's the tick tock i'm just saying you know what i mean like it's it's the tick tockers it's the tick tock shoe over like a jordan one right now i don't know i've never been on twitter same i would say black and white dunks and jordan ones are like the same vibe you have to gift the dunk what are you buying yeah you can give yourselves oh man that is such a hard question brazillos well here's here's the thing and i feel like this is why and maybe you're making me think about this i love those boosts way more than i need to think about it and why the panda dunk is so popular is because the dunk i feel like is iconic for coming in such specific colorways feature to your school yeah where it's like the because you made me think about it for a second and all the dunks that i really like if it's someone who you have to buy a shoe for meeting someone who doesn't have enough shoes of their own they're not going to go out and give them personal favorite out of that whole pack is unlvs yeah shout out jerry tarkanian but is the armenian yes love it uh but i don't you're not going to give someone a gray and red shoe i don't think it's like the one so what would you gift he's not letting you right he's coming i'm not going i'm not i'm not going panda okay because you don't want someone you care about stepping out in a black and white dunk here's the thing i want done i've always wanted at least for the most part the people in my life who i give things to i want them to be differentiated in some way where like maybe they don't know but it's a little like not off but a little it's not like i have the most obvious show yeah a little more like if you know you know why this is cool even if they're not in the sneakers at all yes okay is that fair to say like i gifted my dad the 993's and i got him the army green suede colorway where it's new balance outlet uh joe's new balance outlet yeah and you know it people are like not many people would see that but i post it online and people are like oh snap like yeah he has those you know so maybe i guess it's so hard to pinpoint down one color of a dunk just because there's so many and i'm like which one out of all of these are you gonna gift i feel like he wouldn't be getting a dunk no you wouldn't maybe yeah probably wouldn't be giving a dunk that's whole thing but maybe kentucky lows yeah i feel a little little more i was i was shooting today at a store stadium goods i looked up lot 50 in a size six virgil offwhite dogs give the white lot 50s those shoes are so expensive well the philly is the black one no the one sorry not a lot 50 you like the one you like wow a lot of money i might have to bring those up not that no i have the like lot eight or oh those remind me of uh shout out to thomas pynchon those were mine the days were so close i would say brendan's most i would say your most controversial sneaker editorial you've ever done what oh he's had a baker's dozen controversial for who uh just people who work pr for brands people in the comment section people who work here i would say it it it uh make sure you catch how flush my face is going to go i would say it tote how recent it because you you did a you did um a a photo shoot along with it and doing the photo shoot kind of like towed the line of like not like it was like awful but like some people thank you it wasn't awful no no no no some people may have been like oh man is that a step too far okay well we've got the preamble tell me what it was the the nike um it's not it's a decade oh the decade oh no i i don't feel any guilt about that the nike decade the shoes the one that the whole uh religious group as they might call but you would understand why people might think that's not controversial but you know what i mean i think that people were upset with that i thought this was gonna be something so bad oh i just thought it was like a bit controversial using like the because nike had done a shoe based off of that and they had to cancel it yeah you know and doing like i think you had done the shoe with like the um same purple fabric when the people did the mass suicide when was this this was probably six or seven years ago and of course several years later vice wrote some story about him you know like i was actually  researching we published it on soul collector don't forget who wrote these  stories first the sneaker websites not to somebody at npr if no maybe i don't know you know people at the uh no let me not rant people talking but nobody was upset by that so everybody was inspired someone advice that hit me up last week and i said i was gonna say anything about it but whatever you should someone advice was doing like i guess they have like a most expensivist show or something like that that was gq but i thought it was the two changes i guess maybe two chains brought a device i don't know but they had thought that like and i don't know 100 but i feel like they had thought that sneaker bots were like actual robots and they're like i've come in contact with someone who owns for them and i'm doing the most expensive show i need to like know more about these things and like i like i saw you wrote an article about sneakerbots can you please like sit down with me and explain this whole phenomenon to me dude this is such an insular thing to complain about but we have we have the space to do it now that is like one of the funniest things when somebody will come to you and they're not a sneaker person and it'll be like oh i'm writing about this topic and i see you wrote this story about it already several years ago i'm wondering if i could pick your brain and ask you some questions about this thing and i'm like all the answers to questions we already  reported on years ago and now you want to come to this thing and ask for my time to tell you more about it just go read the story or better yet don't publish your  about the phrase one though is when you get it from people who are like i saw you wrote this story in like 2013 and you clicked the link and it was like you just like aggregating a news story from like oh it wasn't actually some original images all broken yeah it was like something that like i don't know like new york post had written about like some sneaker mishap story you just like reposted it on the website and they're like they're they want to talk to you like you were deep in the mix of the original thing and yeah dude i was working on the internet i think some guy from npr hit me recently and yeah maybe this is i don't know is this bad to just air this no it's funny but it was funny because they had asked me like they were asking about joe and bear and they were like oh i just feel like it'd be so great to get an interview you know i think our audience referring to the npr audience would really love it if we could get an interview and i was like yeah i'm not really going to help you with that if if i could ever get an interview like that i would definitely pursue it myself wait not interviewing you inter getting uh to interview him yeah or something like that that's a little not that they were asking for that directly i don't know some other  out everybody who's writing about sneakers that doesn't actually come from some other sneakers no not really not really not really some other sneaker topics that i guess that we kind of wanted to like go over sure the one we felt like was a kind of a uh swing and a miss or didn't make much sense was donald glover collaborating with new balance hold on this was you you felt this way this is a specific thing well which is fine it's just your record donald glover had collaborated with adidas like a few years ago nobody cared and the shoes just they were all like white canvas sort of like distressed shoes you'd have a hard time remembering them now nobody cared obviously donald glover huge pop cultural person that makes incredible stuff that matters within the space no no no shots at any of the work that he's done outside of sneakers right but like sometimes brands feel the need to like hey this guy's big we need to do a shoe with him let's do it but like don glover's just like not a sneaker guy and that's totally fine you know what i mean it's not really his fault no it's not not but that he had done these he had done the adidas shoes and it was just like you know doesn't like didn't really make sense like on multitude of levels and also the consumer didn't care about it so it's like the consumer votes on what they're doing and yeah and then new like four years later whatever new balance is like hey we're gonna try this again too we're gonna get donald glover and do more distressed sneakers um and i love everyone who's uh affiliated with the have you talked to them about it yes i have really i know he has because he's told this story many times what are you saying i was just not on here i was just like come on man like dudes like you guys are gonna come on man i would no i was like i just said you guys he was bad they gave donald glover a spot that could have went to madwell no it has nothing to do with he didn't tap me for another 991 i just said you guys are doing such like great stuff right now that like actually matters within the space and this one feels like you're trying to force it a little bit for something that doesn't really fit like the brand profile or like square peg round hole yeah the shoes just don't aren't good you know it's like it is what it is like the shoe just aren't good and i don't know and then two days like after like a week after they dropped their shoes your biggest pet peeve this is your biggest pet peeve this is his biggest pet which is funny and it was like when they take off one of his biggest pet peeves respectfully he has many is when a new deal is announced they do like they show the shoes they do like a photo shoot and then a few days later the person's wearing a different brand it signifies to you that that person had no legitimate or lasting collection to the brand yeah it was just like and that's fine like we've all like done sneaker things with brands before where they're not like the end all be all of our infatuation with shoes but it was just funny that like he had the little new balance ad or whatever and then like out of nowhere i wouldn't even expect this to get posted this is the funny part about it is like again this is you're totally i understand your frustration at this but this is all your thing this one all of us being upset about this i think we can all i think we'll i'll ask you if you think that you were confused as to why a hype blog within our space did a news post on donald glover who was half naked walking through the streets with a pair of soccer knees on and felt that was good enough to highlight for a style selection a bit a bit weird but it was perplexing right funny photo but bip like i'm not getting involved because you know that we used to do but i don't think spotted i don't think congratulations i don't think yes but i don't think complex would ever pose no i meant sorry i meant the whole being perplexed at or frustrated by the donald glover new balance now saucony situation i'm not that i'm just did you write any spotted posts yes i did what an era what an era it's like spotted uh theophilus london where's air jordan sevens dakota fanning in the nike air yz2 almost singlehandedly like took down like the complex media empire by like posting paparazzi photography no that's not true is that true that's not true how many of those spotted posts are still available on the website when the paparazzi spots you you use their photo with that perspective when they might have to go back into mama lipuma's cookie jar for that one because that  is not just a whole different uh that's a whole different uh strategy different era yeah i think my favorite uh spotted post ever was um spotted is what spotted it and it was like you see so and so wearing it's like spotted big sean is wearing tshirt with air yeezys it would it was more sneaky it started out sneakers though but yeah but it was like insta real quick it was like an instagram post of before instagram yeah on the website but i think one of my favorite ones is when uh kanye was wearing the independence day air max 90s like throwing like a the paparazzi  mosquito paparazzo and a headlock and they went they exploded yeah yeah and i also think if you like even like tweet that photo out you probably get your like twitter account locked at this point what an error the rights and clearances specialists about those ones not any more air max 90s red blue yeah yeah eventually but then no i know but i'm just saying okay did it go like this no upon release that shoe was like on sale at the finish line and it went up all the way up but then it came back down no one's gonna buy that shoe for more than a couple hundred dollars the biggest issue with that shoe was air max 90 hyper fuse independent three colorways navy white in red yep and they had the american flag on the tongue i think they went on sale for like 7999 or something like that on finish line and then kanye wore the navy pair to knuckle up a paparazzo yes and that shoe for whatever reason for like a brief period in time especially amongst i would say like european tourists okay became like the most heavily like bootleg yes you're right there were a lot of fakes of those you're right yes you're totally right and that shoe was going faded out now but you're right the red pair whatever was going for like maybe like 1200 or something like that but you'd see so many people just wearing fried red like hyper fused uh independence day air max 90s disrespecting this country you know you  come from switzerland or sweden or  belgium or something and you you enjoy this this home of the free this land of the brave but there's certain shows there's it's funny because we had that whole conversation to bring it full circle last week with arthur carr you know where people thought that uh virgil's wife was wearing the fake offwhite bread jordan force but i think there's certain sneaker situations where you can like maybe like put it put together enough like clues whether or not like the shoes are real or not this i can't i can't quite articulate it but this comes back to the same thing about the starter kit shoe and i feel like you are going to see the person and decide whether or not they have no i'm not saying that it's just like sometimes it's like in people can totally have shoes but like sometimes if there's like something that's like super rare or super expensive you know you see someone wearing like and this doesn't have to be the case but you see someone wearing like uh maybe like offwhite chicago or one or something like that and like the shoes are like completely i mean not that someone can't like beat them into the ground but maybe if they're wearing like i don't know like you have questions like a pair of fila track pants with a pair of like offwhite shirts a picture for us chicago this guy chicago ones like you just maybe you just maybe have some questions on like do you do you whether someone's waiting it's just like you know i know i know whether someone's wearing a five thousand dollar shoe you know what i mean like it just it's totally cool to like wear whatever you want do it go ahead unless they're fake yeah or pandas it's totally cool to wear anything you want unless they're pandas or unless you're donald glover donald glover can wear whatever he wants that's on the brand man okay okay okay uh can i give a quick update by the way speaking of offwhite sneakers yeah yes because hold on though hold on air force no yes i want to talk about that because that's what people came to this episode for to hear are you getting like i know i know you know the yellow text on the other show shout outs to the other show full size on the yellow text but i don't know if you're joking are you getting closer to what getting a pair of the louis vuitton yes air force ones you're on the hunt no you're not okay because i can't honestly joe i was trying to have a positive mental attitude about it and i was trying to push through and i was trying to find my angles and work it and get in where i could and work the angles you know what i mean and stay positive throughout but last week with this fake ass raffle i mean not fake it was a real thing i guess but people like the shoe supposedly had sold out within like a minute or something like that but people got stuck on like the landing page it was like four hours classic just sitting around on a landing page having no clue what's happening so we're very close to the point at least with this batch you know some people have said maybe there's gonna be more releasing in the future but i might i might um finally be willing to accept my l on the leader oh i thought you were gonna say you're willing to finally pony up and like cooch said cooch said after the day after he got back from miami he just did a video eating i think a bacon egg and cheese and he goes i'm defeated i'm depleted you know what we can do we can revisit the question of the shoe you saved up the most money or that was the first the first shoe you saved up for but if we want to ever go to the shoe you saved up the most for maybe uh three weeks down the line i will have uh sent a zell payment to pg for twelve thousand dollars have you ever done that have you ever done that have you done that recently put money aside and been like let's put it in an escrow what a mild flex you're like you know i just saved up twelve thousand dollars in three weeks dude i'm not actually gonna do it that's a total  lie i know but just the fact that you're like oh i just put you know i just put four grand aside everywhere no no no no no no not at all i was just making stuff up make sure the texts are unlimited so i got caught up yeah it might cost you a couple phone bills no i think that it pains me to say it but i feel like that the sun has set on that one just about i saw them for the first time in person today at the stadium goods yeah also they're still red white and blue white and green we're still waiting to see if this green offwhite nike air force one materializes yeah maybe unconfirmed at the brooklyn museum i don't know every every other day where are we i know we had a brief offcamera discussion about this so where are we ranking that on the pantheon of virgil's offwhite air force ones just in that section like just in the museum ones that look like that not the silver solution yeah just we're not talking louis vuitton like just like the whole that whole pack can we use or whatever can we agree that the blue one's the best or no mca i think the white one is the best so the answer to that is no joe uh the complex con one yeah we put the complex con one in there yeah that whole set of like shoes that are all different colors yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah friends i know the complex con's just a weird one because the rest are museum ones and the same shoes yeah my friend came up on the complex con one and when i tell you beat them i feel like people just treated it like it was the guy who wealthy is going to see him walking down 7th avenue a regular air force one and beat them but yeah i put the moma's number one black and silver and then i put the black oh you just said you put the mca's number one just changed black and silver blue and silver well i do like i think the white the white pair is the best like in in hindsight i do like uh our our guy chris fidell's story what was his story about about he told them the black and silver ones right yeah sliding up to the line yeah did you see he also like had to like uh like some old new york stuff he had to like yolk someone up basically for stealing a skateboard from his skate shop i love that shout out to chris we got to visit that upper west skates yeah and you got to visit if you're listening to this if you're watching this and you need a a new deck and you want to buy it from native new yorker definitely a new complete did is new deck okay to say uh you can either get a deck or a complete okay for two separate things i just want to make sure i say it right oh one thing that uh i guess mixed emotions about on the internet with sneakers but shout out to our good friend grock i think he had oh i know that's created the content i know where this is going because of his  tweet i go so everyone knows that the gucci gazelles have become a thing right meaning what i thought i knew where i was there are great shoes no i'm not saying they're i'm not i have no qualms time out though talking about where are we going i know do you know i i think i have a suspicion here you know how you we're just saying the fake shoes you're a little suspicious i'm a little suspicious too let me get this off my chest do you tweet things right before the podcast no i don't i don't talk about them i don't i i tweeted this thing i did not it has nothing to do with i'm just saying that it's not a bad strategy no because it's just like these are the thoughts like you asked me what are my thoughts about sneakers recently and it's like if i say if i have if i make a tweet about shoes those are like the thoughts that have been kicking around in my head about sneakers for the past like okay two weeks or whatever this one was an hour i'm sorry i missed the tweet because it was i don't know because it was an hour before the podcast so i want to show you exactly where he shouted our good friend grock okay he had pledged legend he had posted something that shoe game he had posted a video that i think little jupiter had since reposted and it was basically a derivative of if you can't get the gucci gazelles adidas makes a lot of suede sneakers that you can get in on the trend on now right so it was a really nice gazelle okay so they post a pair of gazelle indoors blue suede nice one okay white stripes i watched three seconds this video then i i saw it but i just thought it was not because it's not a good video i just got i just thought it was funny that being someone who for the past like three or four years like exclusively wars wait the look on joe's face right now to tweet us adidas don't paraphrase say the tweet you say the tweet will you say the tweet just say it because it's 100 true all right 2 14 we started recording at what 2 45 i was riding the train i was on the train while i got the tweet off okay i love it everybody had things to get off their chest got slanded across the internet for three years for wearing corny suede adidas and now people are making videos on how to buy gr suede adidas instead of gucci gazelles make it make sense vindicated dude if i hadn't like if people like literally hadn't told me for the past heroes where's your mentions weren't full of people saying to you you don't deserve to be the cohost on a talk show because you wear these shoes that's what people hit me with for like the longest effing time that i don't deserve to have a valid opinion on sneakers because i like wearing suede adidas now that the gucci gazelles are popular people are hopping in and i'm guessing and i don't know but there's probably people out there who want to get in on the gucci gazelle bandwagon can't afford it who probably were like oh welty's corny for wearing these style of shoes come forth show yourself just like come on man you're gonna try and slander me and then like want to like wear the same shoes because like someone made a cool version of it i hope we can  clear that we're clearing it we're clearing it listen to his days of ripping the paparazzi photos yeah no matter how much that costs it's worth it yeah put it in the budget how's the interactions on the tweet you got it off your chest though i don't know listen if you slandered wealthy for wearing suede adidas you better  apologize because it's a new day oh i'm checking all right come on come on any spicy mentions for you on that one i'm so glad we got here we're about to get out of here this is important oh so far 90 98 likes two quote tweets nine comments should we read some of the comments or do we not want to go there uh you're braver than me if you're gonna read your comments a lot on the air oh you know fashion works three years ahead this time you was right and you know what you get for that don't be scared internet internet needs to let matt live his life and it's jamie kennedy don't be hating from transwelty it's a trend and then someone tried to say it was your ankles no show the hitter no all right he got it off his chest listen you gotta you got a shiny nickel i guess yeah i don't know i just wanna it was no i'm glad we the background is important yep i knew it though i knew him i know him a lot i knew exactly where he was going he also brought it to slack listen all i'm just gonna say is you can't try to go out there and hate on me i'm not saying you oh no one else at all right you can't try to go everybody accept us yes you can't go out there and try to hate on me for something and then a few years later do the exact same thing and not wow expect me to he knows he's  remember that wow and come back and say i remember those days mental filing cabinet dude remembers every colorway of the  992 that released in the fourth quarter of 2009 you think he wasn't gonna remember your slander from a couple  years ago you are dead ass wrong you are dead wrong pepperidge farm remembers right wait what is that like in the cookie jar that's a meme right oh yeah all right listen we got it in here i don't get to get anything off my chest no i'm kidding i'm kidding i'm getting off kidding nonconfrontational passiveaggressive as always i have nothing to do we had a moment there around 23 minutes ago right right all right listen this has been the complex sneakers podcast we hope everyone has a great weekend please like subscribe we will see you next week", "all right a little behind the scenes so my mom she writes the scripts for the podcast and what people don't see is that over the course of the week leading up to the release of the new podcast on mondays there is a lot of back and forth a lot of me reading and not just reading but reading out loud the the scripts that she sends over which are usually quite good already but i kind of add a couple touches here and there to make sure it's mine this also gives me a chance over the course of the week as we're doing these kind of back and forths to begin to internalize the story because when i record a podcast or as you see with my youtube videos um i'm not reading a script i am looking at a script in my my computers right here so i'm looking at a script and now i feel like i jacked up the angle of the camera but whatever i'll look at the script and then i will effectively read it from memory but it takes a lot of time to begin to internalize the story so um this is what it looks like when i get a script from my mother jesse thuma that's her name uh she's the best she's been writing the podcast now for really since its inception so the podcast is really overwhelmingly her writing um i do this i just read it out loud to myself all right so i'm midway through the story like so many people arriving in chicago for the first time the pitzel family could hardly believe the noise and crowds and the skyscrapers in the center of the city that towered over oh could hardly believe the noise and crowds and the skyscrapers in the center of the city that towered above the streets like the walls of a canyon another thing they couldn't believe was the smell from the huge stockyards in south chicago it wasn't just the smell of livestock it was the stink from the slaughterhouses located along the south side railroad that made chicago the meat packing capital of the united states and hog butcher for the world and it goes on and on and on from there but uh this is what it looks like uh there's probably hours and hours of just kind of going back and forth my mom does a lot of the writing all the writing for the podcast i'll read it make sure it sounds good add my two cents uh and she puts probably about 50 60 70 hours or so into every single podcast and then i put about you know at the high end maybe 10 hours on the back end that includes recording editing and putting it up but uh my mom has been a godsend for the podcast and um couldn't do without her so shout out to you mom love you", "oh you know if somebody told me these things earlier things would have been so much easier and i'm about to share them with you in this video i want to share with you five different things that nobody will tell you when you're starting a podcast maybe you've started one already or you are about to start your own podcast either way make sure you watch this video all the way through because not only i'm going to tell you these five things which unfortunately are all bad things i'm also going to share with you through advice that i've learned over the last decade of podcasting how to counter each of these five bad things and at the end i'm gonna share with you a specific strategy that has worked crazy for myself and my students for getting more reviews which is really important for your podcast so make sure to stick around for that it'll be working for you guaranteed hey my name is pat flynn host of the smart passive income podcast started in 2010 i've since recorded over 1600 episodes have amassed over 65 million downloads and the one thing i've learned to start off with is podcast analytics are terrible they they suck really bad let's go over the list you get uh from your podcast host you get the number of downloads um and plays which is kind of the same thing and that's kind of it now you also get some information like what device people are playing these podcasts on and you know what country they might be in yeah it's it's not a lot to work with especially if you've been on youtube and you've seen the analytics here which is just kind of insane it's a little overwhelming in fact but in the podcast world we're still catching up fortunately things seem to be moving in the right direction with apple's podcast connect same thing with google podcast manager but overall we just don't have that much to work with so how do we improve our show how do we get better how do we take what we do have access to and improve ourselves well here's the trick we want to trend upward we want more downloads over time not every episode will be downloaded more than the last hopefully that would be awesome but generally speaking you want an upward curve that would allow for some sort of trends in growth that's how you know that you're doing things right pay attention to the episodes that seem to be standing out and getting more popular or have more downloads do more of that do less of the ones that have less downloads number two just starting a podcast does not mean you're going to get listeners back in the old days by old days i mean like 2010 you could get a podcast up and you get featured in new and noteworthy for eight weeks and you get a ton of downloads right away and now with over a million podcasts which in the scheme of things isn't a lot but it's definitely saturated right now doesn't mean you can't succeed though you have to work a little bit harder to gain listeners just putting it up there if you build it they're not going to come ray people will come ray now there are a few instances and a lot of rare cases where people who do put a podcast up and they literally do no extra work and they amass a ton of downloads that is possible kind of anywhere right but there are some things you can do to increase your likelihood of getting listeners number one make sure that when you launch your show you make a big deal out of it utilize your network your social media following family friends whatever make some noise the moment that you launch number two a great way to grow your show is to be a guest on other people's shows so do that people are already listening and they can follow you and subscribe from there number three just realize that it's going to take some time you've got to stay consistent and this takes us to number three trace nobody's going to tell you how hard it is to stay consistent with your content yes you can get excited at the start of your podcast journey with maybe 10 episodes you got them out there you're fired up we call that the honeymoon period of podcasting where things are exciting and you're going to work a little bit harder but once you start to see that maybe the results aren't where you want them to be or it starts to get hard because you're editing every show and then life starts to get in the way you might experience what's called pod fade we don't want you to pod fade away that consistency is really key to show up every single week or twice a week or however often you choose to come out with your show that's what will help your audience understand when to expect your show to come out and guarantee more likely at least that a person will continue to listen to you over time the best way to counter this is to plan ahead so get ahead on your content calendar figure out what those episodes are going to be about figure out who you want to have on your show as a guest so you can schedule things ahead of time and never feel like you're in that content hamster wheel that we all feel on where once you hit publish when you should be celebrating you're already worried about the next episode coming out and you have no time to market your show you can counter that by getting ahead planning ahead number four social media is probably the number one way that people are trying to grow their show and it's actually a terrible terrible strategy don't get me wrong posting your episodes on social media facebook linkedin twitter instagram etc it's smart you might as well do that but it's not going to give you the growth that you're looking for here's why when you share on social media guess who's seeing it everybody who already follows you yes you might get a few retweets or have a few people share it but it's not necessarily going to give you that landslide group of people who are going to come who have never found you before that's what we want to happen the way to get more people to come on your show who have yet to discover you is not through social media it's by getting elsewhere where other groups of people exist this might be being a guest on another person's podcast it might be being featured in a forum or group within a social media platform it might be speaking on stage or sharing your podcast at an event or a virtual event that you might be speaking at it might be creating content that is niched down in such a way that people within that niche start spreading the word for you this in fact happened to me in episode 96 of the smart passive income podcast when i created an episode to help people who did art like sculpting painting drawing etc make more money online that was interesting because i didn't think that that episode was going to go very well but that year that was the number one most downloaded episode in my archive why because people started to share it with other people like them too so niching down actually can help you grow your show too yeah just relying on social media and in fact a lot of people who repurpose their show meaning taking the audio or maybe even filming it and then posting it on social media or sharing like a videogram or something like that on social media guess what you're probably spending a lot more time and money sharing your show with people who already know your show exists how might you find other people i've already showed you that information so take that and use it and number five the thing that they're not going to tell you is that getting reviews is like pulling teeth it's hard it hurts like tom hanks and castor you could ask your listeners all day in every single episode and you still might not get people to leave a review two important things here including my best tip to help you get more reviews but first let me start with one thing reviews you might not see all of them that might come in because you're only seeing reviews that come in from your home country or wherever your home country is for your podcast on apple for example in order to see other countries reviews of your show you'd have to actually go to the apple store for that country to see it there is a workaround however i recommend checking out podkitecom not sponsored it's just a great tool that will help you actually collate and actually see all those different reviews from all those different countries in one spot and i think it's free i don't remember the price plan right now but i think you can claim one podcast at least your podcast for free right now again podkitecom now for what you've been waiting for how might you get more reviews like i said just asking your general audience on the podcast or even on social media hey please leave a review for me please please please it's not going to work out very well here's what i would recommend you do it's a twostep process step one on social media or in your email send a message that says who here has listened to the latest episode and what was a big lesson that you took away from it or something of that nature where you get people to essentially raise their hand and say oh yeah i listened to the show um i thought it was awesome okay good you got people saying yes i listen to the show the second step is reaching out to each of those people who reply individually in a direct message on that social media platform so let's say i do this on instagram right and then i see people reply i'm going to take my phone i'm going to direct message them and i'm going to send them a video i promise you the video works better than anything number one people are going to be blown away that you the podcast host of the podcast they listen to is reaching out individually to them plus you already know that they like the show or else they wouldn't have raised their hand so when you ask them individually like this hey jim thanks so much for listening to the podcast i saw your comment on the other post there it'd be really cool if you just had a moment to leave a review on apple be really really helpful for the show and it helps others understand the kind of value that i have to provide thank you so much for listening this will get a very high response rate and again it'll blow people's mind this individual reach out yes some things are not scalable in business and that's okay if you want more reviews do that i guarantee it's going to work so those are five things that they're not going to tell you who's they well not people like me because i just told you what'd we learn number one podcast analytics or poo poo number two just starting a podcast does not guarantee listeners you're gonna have to be consistent work hard reach out and actually market your show too number three creating content consistently is a hard thing to do let's get ahead plan ahead on your calendar make it a little bit easier on yourself number four social media not so great at growing your show yes it's a great reminder for people who've already found you but i want you to see how you might be able to reach out to new groups of people who have yet to find and listen to your podcast and number five reviews are tough to get and they're not all put in one spot podcatcom plus the step strategy that i just shared with you now i teach a lot of people how to podcast and if you'd like a cheat sheet to make sure you're doing all the right things with your show whether you're just getting started or you've been starting already all you have to do is go to

first game is in kansas city against the chargers i haven't been i mean i've been dedicated to a spirit interview with mahomes but i have never worked a game oh that's not true that's not true i worked a game a bazillion years ago sidelines when her edwards was actually the coach in kansas city that's how long ago it was what's your place for best stadium lambo it's just always the like for me the whole epicenter that is football and i mean i know you've that's your second home so maybe it's not for you but it is for me just nostalgia and everything that you know that when the town owns the team it doesn't get much better sure do i'm joking all right jrep021 i feel the same way by the way about yeah oh yeah okay yeah beach or pool um i love a beach i am afraid of sharks we do have some great whites in hermosa i don't find the water to be very very warm so i kind of love a pool what about you um it depends on the beach um i like a beach i like sitting i like the whole sand vibe um pool sometimes i worry about did you like people peeing in the pool i was so afraid and i don't know if this is like an old wives tale but like if you pee in the pool like then there's a die that like comes out and it turns your pee like a certain color not that i'd pee in the bowl but i think about that all the time that if i was to pee in the pool that like i would be outed i would but the one pool that still has this weird dye that's in it so i would say i'm more of a beach person so here's a pet peeve of mine and this is just disgusting i think and i'm not saying your hair right now wet hair really grosses me out in a pool and i just think of being in a pool and the pool's going through everybody's hair and body hair like that's just absolutely what makes me want to puke how about when um i don't know if you've ever done this but like when people pull their hair out and like i've been on a trip with girls and they'll put it on the side of the shower so it doesn't like clog the drain and like you go in there and i'm like what is go why is it yeah if anyone knows what i'm talking about like you've been on a girls trip and they you were in a sorority yeah i wasn't i wasn't in the sorority but i could rent a room from the sorority because when i transferred up there they like would rent rooms out to like whatever older people like me who was transferring in so they were the same thing i'm like these putting their hair on the side of the shower gross um okay oh my phone locked hold up i got you the k dugan nick saban or jimbo who is your fave this is all you

down with erin and carissa is a production of i heart radio for more podcasts from iheartradio visit the iheartradio app apple podcast or wherever you get your podcasts", "hey what's going on it's mike and i'm here with another episode of smart simple digitally so i love podcasts like i listen to a bunch of podcasts i look forward to the to some of my favorite podcasts coming out each week the same way that some people might look forward to their favorite shows airing on tv every week you know they are by far you know when it comes to digital media they're by far one of my favorite sources for information and entertainment no question however i am constantly reminded that there are still a lot of people out there who don't know what the heck podcasts are or who might have heard the term podcast but still don't have really much clue on how to start exploring them and listening to them so i figured i would do today's talk you know this podcasts oneonone talk just to serve as a reference for anybody out there who might be interested in learning more about podcasts and looking for some tips on how to start exploring them and listening to them so that's what today's episode is all about so a podcast is a recorded audio series you can think of it as like a radio show and you know they're packaged these episodes and made available online and from there anyone can subscribe to them and they can download them to a computer or a smartphone and from there you can then listen to them anytime you want to the really cool thing about podcasts is that they come in a variety of formats and genres you know literally like their there is quite possibly a podcast or multiple podcasts that exist for just about any interest or topic that you can think of you know i mean right off the bat i can think of pod this is the different categories of podcasts that exist you know they are comedy podcasts once i focus on news politics pop culture cooking books tv religion technology i mean you name it there's likely a podcast out there that exists the other thing is they come in all sorts of formats so there's some podcasts there are oneonone dialogues or oneonone interview so every episode the host is sitting down with the different guests and they are just having a qa discussion they're also podcasts that are roundtable discussions or panel discussions where you may have two or more hosts and every episode they're talking about just a wide range of subjects and maybe happenings in pop culture etc then they you also have podcasts that take the form of storytelling so you may have a host or multiple hosts and they are using sound effects or sound bites from various sources just to craft a really interesting there and a really interesting story whether fiction or nonfiction you also have podcasts that are talks you know where every episode the host is giving a talk or sermon or some type of instruction or inspiration if you will so all sorts of different formats or podcasts in addition to that the other thing that makes pockets really cool is that they can be creative by anyone so you have your just regular everyday people creating podcasts you know about whatever things that they or maybe experts in or be really passionate about you know have companies who are getting into the podcast game and they're producing podcast you know about you know whatever their brand or market might be and then you also have celebrities now who are podcasting and you know it's just a really really really diverse field right now which makes podcast is really cool and interesting so just to give you a bit of backstory little history on podcast pakka has have actually been around since the early 2000s however the main difference between podcasts as they existed then versus podcasts now completely comes down to accessibility so back in the early days you needed to number one in order to discover and to listen to podcast number one needed to have a computer with an internet connection number two you needed to have a special type of software installed in your computer in order to access and to download episodes of podcasts and then number three you needed to have an mp3 player and if you're not familiar an mp3 player was and is i guess they still exist they are portable music players i guess the the more of the popular the most popular one at the time back in the early 2000s was apple's ipod but of course there were many different types that were around so the way the process would work is number one you had to know that that that a podcast existed because there was a point in time where there was not a central directory for podcasts you would either discover them because you were following maybe a blogger online who created one once you knew what the feed was where that podcast was stored at you would then use that podcast software that you had installed on your computer you would use that to then download new episodes of the podcast from that person that you followed and then you'd have to plug your mp3 player you have to connect your mp3 player to your computer and then transfer those files those mp3 files those new episodes of that podcast that you were subscribed to you would down you would transfer those files over to your mp3 player and then then you listen to those episodes on your mp3 player that's how that's how we'll go and you would have to follow those steps every time a new episode of your favorite podcast came out as time went on as we now are here today those steps still exist but they have been simplified tremendously so you can do all of those steps that i just explained you can now do all those things really just one location and in most cases is the simplest way to do it is right on your phone you don't have to you don't really need a computer anymore i mean you don't have to to know any specific feeds on where the podcasts are located all those things are normally just simplified and centralized all in one location on your phone so the quickest and simplest way to get started exploring and listening to podcasts is with your smartphone and with a podcast app so if you have an iphone you should use the whole recommend that you start by using the the native the podcast app becomes preinstalled on your iphone and if you have an android device i recommend that you start with the google play music app at a very base level all podcast apps are the same they're gonna offer you some of the same basic features these the ones that are most important number one they're going to give you the ability to discover and explore the realm of podcasts so you'll be able to to see the podcasts out there just by category you can explore by category just to see what's out there you can explore by popularity so you'll be able to see the top charts to see what podcasts are really kind of hot right now what's going on you'll also be able to discover podcasts by keywords you can search based on your interests based on topics that you're looking for also a podcast apps will give you the ability to subscribe so once you find a podcast that you're interested in you can click the subscribe button and then what happens there after that point is that every time a new episode becomes available it will automatically get placed over into a special section in your podcast app where you can easily find it in some cases getting notified every time a new episode is available so you can just go in and start listening and you you know kind of a name it eliminates the step eliminates the hassle of every time having to go into the app and just search for your podcast instead once you subscribe all the new episodes will be automatically kind of sifted out and placed in a special section for you just to start to listen and then the other kind of main feature the other common feature most important feature that all podcast apps will give you the ability to do is to listen so you will be able to listen to podcasts those that you either subscribe to or just as you're just going through exploring and you see some it catches your eye you can just start to instantly listen to them so that's my tip i think again that's the quickest simplest way to start exploring podcasts are to explore and to listen to them just to start start with your smartphone and start with the apps the native apps that are available for your smartphone again if you have an iphone use the podcast app becomes french song if you have an android phone use the google play music app i would recommend those too as good starting points and then from there as you get more comfortable as your tastes grow your demand so for different features grow then you can start to branch out and explore some of the other thirdparty podcasts apps that exist out there there are a bunch of them so those are my tips i hope that this information has been helpful and i hope that it helps to to get you started on your journey to start exploring and listening to podcasts as always if you have any questions leave them down below in the comments you know don't be afraid to reach out to me with questions that you may have and if you like this information again if you found it helpful please like it and subscribe to this channel as well and again if there's anything any any things that you'd like me to talk about in some of the upcoming episodes let me know as well and drop those down below in the comments also as always thanks for watching and i'll see you next time take it", "have you read the bhagavadgita yes okay like what's in that book why do people say that you open any page of it and you'll get your answer why do people say things like that sure sure i think the first thing to know is let's let's remove the religion aspect from the bhagavadgita totally but it does not a religious book it is a book which gives you the way to live and the setting for the bhagavadgita is the battlefield of kuruksetra the mahabharata where origins confused right and krishna becomes his mentor and gives him guidance in a way that he can now start doing what it meant to do right so every young man or lady is going to have confusions every young person is going to have those dilemmas to do or not to do to be or not to be that's exactly how the gita begins it begins with confusion it begins with dilemmas it begins with a lack of meaning and then krishna kind of guides arjun through and empowers arjuna to make his own choices krishna only acts as a facilitator and empowers arjuna to understand that he is way to more power the people is going to face in the value every young man lady needs to understand that they are way more powerful than what they are going through at the moment their confusions are smaller than them their challenges are smaller than them the problems are smaller than them their heartbreaks as painful as they are but are still smaller than them and they have the capacity to work on that person paints that they're going through so i think that's precisely where books like the gita helped a lot because they build in you that sense of confidence and strength and strength fortitude but i have the power as a spiritual being overcome everything that's going on going on in my life and i have the power to be able to make a difference than that impact because i am a spiritual being can you can you reference like three big lessons from the bhagavad gita that stayed with you specifically one of the lessons that stayed with me from the gita is a particular text from the second chapter of the gita which talks about the summer and the winter season right and this particular text says that the summer and the winter season keeps coming and going every year new seasons change and just because the seasons change we never stop performing our duties let's say for example it's chicago and the temperatures are minus 27 degrees celsius people don't stop their work still let's say it's daily it's 43 degree celsius people are still on and going on with their regular life with a few adjustments here and there obviously so this text of the geeta chapter 2 tells us that we have to learn to tolerate the ups and downs and not be distracted from what i mean purposes like when we talk about tolerating failures and pains we can understand we also have to learn to tolerate a success and the good times because both distract us you know usually we only look at the negatives as distractions but even the positives distract us from what we are meant to be doing well that's something that really kind of stayed with me the second thing that i really kind of resonate with with in the gita is a verse from the sixth chapter which talks about the mind being a friend or an enemy to you it depends on how you deal with the mind okay nine if you befriend your mind the mind will become you become your friend and will empower you to do what you want to do but if you don't deal with it rightly then the mind will become your enemy and will lead to your downfall i'll give you an example you want to get up early in the morning to go for a jog go for a workout because you know you want to be fit you know your days are busy and you decide this is going to be my plan for the year 2020 right you set up the alarm clock to wake up early in the morning five six whatever and when the alarm goes what's the mind saying the first thing you slept last late last night take it easy oh maybe this is not the right thing for you to do reminds constantly playing games right now if you have a mind which is constantly giving these kind of reasons you're not going to wake up on the other hand if you learn to train your mind using the proper intellectual process right proper spiritual process your mind can be a greatest asset in your friend which is meditation good meditation books right correct friends correct friends the right kind of company all of these are inputs so that your mind kind of becomes a friend and the third thing from the gita that connects to me a lot is how do we start looking at the presence of divinity everywhere in every aspect we don't have to necessarily go to a place of worship hmm to look at the presence of divinity mmm you can look at the presence of divinity in nature you can look at the presence of divinity in other people you can start looking at the splendor of the create or the creation of you can start looking at the plndr of the creator in the creation you know which is precisely why this is something that i usually tell people is when you look at somebody who's better than you you know and specially there in the same field usually there is insecurity there's insecurity that he's disguised doing better than me in what i am doing or there is envy jealousy sometimes it goes to the extent of sabotaging that other person's work and it happens so when you start looking at divinity in creation you start looking at how divinity is empowered somebody to do something in a special way that person has been gifted by higher powers right and to sabotage that person's work or to be envious about the person or to be feel insecure means actually insulting somebody who's given that gift you know but if i look at that person and derive inspiration from that person i can seek that inspiration to follow my aspiration you know that that aspect of the geetha also kind of really resonates with me that you start looking at divinity everywhere and in every place around you including people who are doing better because it's not them you can see straight away very often i see people who do remarkable stuff and they usually when they speak they say it's they doing it and of course they're doing it no doubt that there's a part of part that they're doing but you can tell that there is something beyond them that's kind of making them do it whether it's acting speaking singing thing with an element which is not necessarily effort mmm not their effort xfactor xfactor and when you start appreciating that x factor is divinity or that something that really kind of connects to me as well you", "all right so you want a podcast but you don't know how to get started this video is gonna show you just how simple it is to get your podcast going specifically we'll look at one gear needed to set up a solo podcast to your needed to set up a podcast with two or more people three audio software for editing your podcast for quick tips and best practices for getting your podcast to sound as good as possible five how to get your podcast out to the world now one more thing while lots of podcasts do incorporate video today we're gonna be focusing on the traditional audio only podcast so let's get to it if you're gonna do a podcast by yourself then you're gonna need a few pieces of gear of all the components of any podcasting setup the microphone is the most important because it's responsible for how your voice sounds in podcasting we know me choose between three types of mics usb mics which are digital or dynamic and condenser mics which are analog we definitely will get into the specific differences between these later but i will tell you right now that if you're in search of the easiest solo podcast set up the usb mic is the way to go and here's why usb mics employ a simple plugandplay approach you just plug it into your computer or your smartphone or tablet if you have the right adapters record to whichever app or software you're using listen through your headphones and that's it let me show you an example here i have the popular blue yeti usb microphone and all i have to do is plug it into this computer's usb port verify that the computer recognizes it when i open my software and i'm good to go there's really no need for any additional gear resize headphones which makes this setup very compact when shopping for a usb mic one feature you should definitely look for is a builtin headphone jack for the volume control so you can hear yourself and adjust your level in real time having this feature on the mic itself makes monitoring your voice simple the yeti by the way also incorporates an independent microphone gain knob for adjusting the input level of your voice which is useful not surprisingly there are many other usb mic models to choose from and depending on your recording environment one type may be better than the other what i mean is the yetis are pretty sensitive mic with a side address design which means is gonna pick up a lot of sound from the room in so if you're podcasting in a somewhat noisy environment you may want to offer something totally different like the rode podcaster usb this is a front address mic with a precise pickup range that's gonna give you good rejection of background noise and still sound really good for your voice it looks cool too kind of makes you feel like you have your own radio show or something if you're worried about ambient sounds making their way into your recordings the road is a solid choice when your podcast includes two or more people you should not use usb mics using more than one usb mic at the same time often causes major communication problems between the mics and the device you're recording to instead you should choose either dynamic or condenser mics which are analog mics with professional xlr connections these mics plug into a separate device like an audio interface or a portable recorder or even a standalone podcast machine so for example here's the popular shore sm7b plugged into a focus right  i  scarlett audio interface which then connects to the computer so i can record an audio into my software of choice it's a pretty simple setup actually and i'll say that one of the things i like about audio interfaces is that they tend to have quieter cleaner preamps than other devices which allows you to capture a really high quality audio these interfaces are also often bundled with the useful software plugins for further editing your vocals after you've finished recording now i could do an almost identical setup with a condenser mic i've swapped out the sm7b for an akg 214 a great sounding condenser that's an excellent choice for vocal recording so that begs the question why choose a dynamic mic over a condenser or vice versa well there are some differences between the two that are important to know when it comes to choosing which is best for you dynamic mics are known to reject background noise very well so if you're going to be conducting your podcast in a room there's a lot of ambient sound or even distracting noises think a kitchen with a humming refrigerator or the neighbors noisy air conditioner then a dynamic mic would be a wise choice a dynamic mic is also advantageous when you have more than one podcaster speaking as the mic is less likely to pick up much of the other person's voice something to keep in mind is that dynamic mics require a bit more microphone technique in that you need to try and keep your mouth close to the mic to ensure consistent recording levels now condenser mics differ from dynamics a few ways the first being that they require something called phantom power or plus 48v which basically gives them enough juice to operate properly this isn't something you really have to worry about because most good audio gear gives you the option of engaging phantom power for condenser mics with a simple flip of a switch condenser mics are also much more sensitive than dynamics so they're well suited for quiet or professionally treated recording environments in addition to utilizing audio interfaces you can use dynamic or condenser mics to record into a separate audio recorder like this zoom h6 this is a good option if portability is important to you especially if you're recording a podcast outside or in an area where you really need to maintain a small footprint things to keep in mind though are that portable recorders tend to have less professional preamps and interfaces and they often only have one headphone output so you may need to use an external headphone amp if you have multiple people in your podcast lastly after you've recorded with one of these recorders you will need to transfer the audio to a computer for editing purposes alright i want to talk about standalone podcast machines for a minute companies like rode and zoom and put out gear that is specifically made to accommodate podcasts the advantage to an allinone podcast machine is that you have the option of recording to the device alone using it as an interface with your computer for recording to software or recording to both device and your computer simultaneously standalone podcast machines also have convenient features like multiple microphone inputs faders to control audio levels sound paths to add audio effects of backing music usb connectivity to interface with your computer multiple headphone outputs for podcast talent and a lot more let's move on to podcasting accessories and talk about a few things you should have or may even need for your setup headphones you should invest in a decent pair of over ear closed back studio headphones this type of headphone does a good job of keeping sound from leaking out it tends to be comfortable for long hours of use most importantly studio headphones are more accurate and reproducing sound so you can hear what things really sound like when you're talking you don't have to buy anything crazy or expensive models like audio technica's ath m20x or m30 x are good examples of affordable quality headphones for podcasting and there are a whole lot more out there if you have more than one person participating in your podcast but your gear only provides a one headphone output then you'll need a headphone so everyone can hear what's going on this mackey hm4 is just one of many examples out there it would be a good solution for providing multiple headphone outs to your talent your podcast audio suffers from closes you know those hard consonant sounds like peas and c's and t's a pop filter will solve that issue some models only cost about 10 bucks and they're definitely worth the investment depending on how you have your gear set up you'll either want a weighted tabletop stand or a boom arm choose whichever is the most comfortable for you one isn't better than the other a quick note on incorporating phone calls into your podcast if you plan on recording calls for your show then you want to make sure that your podcast setup is equipped to handle these calls if you can try to get gear that has a mixed  function which enables you to integrate phone calls into your show clearly and without that annoying echo and feedback you sometimes hear interfaces like focusrite scarlett 4i for mark 3 feature mix  so  zooms l8 recorder in terms of how you connect your phone tear devices some allow for calls via bluetooth whereas others only provide analog connections through a mini jack when using a computer to handle and record your calls voip or voice over internet protocol applications like skype and google hangouts have builtin features that let you record your phone calls you can even use ios and android apps to record phone calls directly to your smart phone or tablet to see how we handle phone calls for podcasting check out links in the description to our videos on focus writes for i four zooms l8 and rhodes road castor pro when it comes to editing your podcast you will need to use a computer and audio editing software let's quickly highlight a few to show you the differences between them audacity this is a super popular software it's mac and windows compatible and best of all it is free you can make precise edits export your audio in various formats import audio into your production pretty much whatever you want to do it's also open source which means that the user community is constantly adding support to improve the program garageband if you're a mac user you should have gotten a free version of garageband that came with your computer this software allows you to record audio and midi and do basic editing and it's really a more simplified less professional version of apple's logic but it's certainly more than capable of letting you edit a podcast avid pro tools this is pretty much is considered the most professional software for recording audio and it has way more features than you'll ever need keep in mind that pro tools runs on a subscription model so you're gonna have to purchase the software then renew annually this is something to consider when you think about budgeting for your podcast setup at this point you're ready to record an edit your podcast so let's go over some basic tips for recording great audio 1 choose good equipment that suits your needs and fits your budget to choose an environment that is as quiet as possible 3 use acoustic treatment to tighten the sound of your room if you hear a lot of echoes or sound bouncing off the walls try something like a rug or curtains in the room even acoustic foam to get rid of those issues 4 use good mic technique to ensure consistent recording levels 5 use a pop filter to prevent those closest we talked about earlier 6 set your mic gain so that your incoming level is roughly between 12 and 34 on the meter this will help prevent clipping and distortion in your audio and 7 this is pretty obvious but check everyone's headphone levels before you press record now once you're done recording it's time to edit and there are some techniques you can employ to make your audio sound as good as possible for the purposes of this video i'm only gonna list some suggestive techniques however you should check out our video titled how to fix your audio in postproduction which is linked in the description below here we go 1 cut out unwanted audio from your recording pretty obvious to normalize your tracks to

that actually play your podcasts such as itunes stitcher spotify soundcloud and others many hosting sites offer free trials so give them a whirl to decide which one suits your purposes and that's it as you can see it doesn't take a whole lot to get a podcast up and running and since podcasting is still the fastest growing audio medium available there is no better time than now to start your own show this is a bee from bh thanks so much for watching and i'll see you next time so you want a podcast but you don't know how to sit i'm having a drink as soon as the six o'clock kids", "is very hard to control the mind with the mind and i think a simple rule that people can adopt is when your mind is not where you want it to be look to your body use the body to shift the mind hi everyone drew road here our guest today is dr andrew huberman and he's here to teach us how to optimize our brain to reduce fear and laziness and increase motivation it's a fascinating conversation this is andrew's round two on the podcast stay tuned andrew welcome back to the podcast an honor to have you here and also i just prefer in person so much so this is great that this all ended up happening it's great thanks for having me back and i agree to do it in person is uh especially nice i want to start off with the topic of fear you know your lab is known amongst many things one of your primary areas is studying fear and there's this topic that comes up for a lot of people in fact it was a big question that people had after our part one which was fantastic and it was around laziness and and motivation and for somebody who's struggling with laziness and motivation what is it that they're missing out when it comes to how fear fits into those two as drivers for good or for for worse yeah it's an interesting question you know we don't often think about motivation and fear as in the same breath or the same sentence um we are accustomed to thinking about the fact that when we're afraid of something you know we can freeze up uh but really motivation and fear are in the same pathway and believe it or not they're in the same chemical pathway so the only way to talk about motivation is to talk about the molecule dopamine dopamine is known for its feelgood properties we think oh you know a dopamine hit or you know it feels so good a rush of dopamine but dopamine's main role in the brain and body is craving motivation and pursuit okay and in the absence of dopamine we don't feel motivated i'll describe in a moment a classic experiment that illustrates this beautifully but dopamine's main role is to make us feel motivated and to crave things okay and the interesting thing is that dopamine is the chemical it's the molecule from which another molecule is made called epinephrine and epinephrine has another name which is adrenaline so to untangle all that basically craving and desire is the foundation of stress and fear and people think well that how could that possibly be well stress and fear comes from adrenaline so the way to think about this in a in a kind of real world context is that when we are afraid of something we have one of three responses we can either remain still we can retreat or we can move forward all three of those require some increase in our level of activation and the molecule adrenaline also called epinephrine i probably will use those interchangeably so it really doesn't matter adrenaline epinephrine that is what what's responsible for getting us moving it's also responsible for our sense of fear and paralysis in fear so if people are feeling that they're not motivated or as motivated as they would like to be there's a key step that people need to take which is to start focusing on the craving aspect and dopamine because if you can make enough dopamine you can motivate you can actually crave moving through challenge so we can talk about how to do that but just to underscore how powerful this relationship is between motivation and dopamine there was an experiment that was done it was been done in rats but it's also essentially been done in humans through naturally occurring things where basically if you put a rat next to a lever with some juice or or even with um you know something really really good that a rat likes they will press that lever for that delicious tasting thing and they get pleasure from it if but if you take a rat and you deplete it of dopamine and you move that lever one rat length away it won't even move one length of its own body right a few inches to hit that lever and people are the same way you can still experience pleasure without dopamine but you won't get up off your couch you won't challenge yourself to go talk to somebody you want to talk to you won't apply for a job you won't pursue the new uh you know fitness protocol etc so dopamine is about craving of pleasure it's not pleasure itself and fear comes from this pathway right this pathway of dopamine into epinephrine and the way to think about fear is it's just one other dimension of motivation and we can talk more about that but if people are living in fear it is absolutely essential to understand that developing some sense of craving even if it feels scary you know wanting something but being afraid to pursue it that's the the trigger for these molecules to start being released and to move towards it but we've all sort of um been told or conditioned that if we feel fearful that that's a sign that we should back away or stand still and biologically that's just not true so if people are feeling paralyzed in fear or they are feeling as if they you know are unmotivated it's absolutely essential that they identify some kernel some little bit of something that draws them forward and if they feel that agitation the kind of elevated heart rate the anxiety a little bit of sweating this kind of thing you know just imagining that they want that thing that's great those are the molecules that i'm talking about starting to kick into gear but for some reason most people start feeling those sensations and they start freezing up or backing away i hope that was clear it was definitely clear so i guess the question is do you think that fear is the primary driver for people who are feeling lazy and unmotivated i do i mean there are two sides to this i mean and you see this a lot in the kind of psychological discussion around motivation it's you know it's wonderful to think about moving towards things purely from a place of love and joy you know and we feel that and we experience that with a child or with a puppy or um when we hear suddenly you know music that we love we we feel that these same molecules are are liberated into our body and brain and we feel that positive motivation but i think it's and that's beautiful and that's a wonderful dimension of life but i i think that it's a mistake to assume that that's how it's going to feel to pursue the everything and the other side of this is that when there's fear where you can also be quite motivated you know i think we we're we're so um averse to the idea of pursuing things out of fear you know should someone start running i'll just i'll use myself as an example i'll embarrass myself by saying you know i i read recently that the guidelines for physical fitness um and cardiovascular health because i'm 45 i'm like probably start thinking about my heart health i feel healthy but it's 150 minutes per week of elevated heart rate you know of that cardiovascular exercise which i haven't been doing at all i do other things but i just haven't been doing that at all and um i always enjoy it once i'm doing it regularly but the first couple of weeks are painful it's a little back thing and you know all the stuff crops up but basically i'm doing it out of fear right i don't wanna i don't wanna die of a heart attack and if you look at the numbers if you're not getting 150 minutes a week minimum of cardiovascular exercise your probability of having a cardiovascular incident goes way up and you can pretend it's not going to happen because of your genetics or you can do all sorts of you know mental gymnastics but the reality is that everyone should be getting that minimum including me and i wasn't so fear is the motivator in that case so fear is a is a terrific motivator and i think that we're so afraid of things like adrenal burnout or or chronic stress and those things are problematic for many people but i think that fear itself is a tremendously powerful lever and when i say a lever i mean a chemical lever this dopamine epinephrine relationship the fact that dopamine this molecule of craving and epinephrine this molecule of motivation and agitation this kind of like stress the fact that those are such close cousins is never going to be untangled and so the the doing a lot of psychological work to try and just move towards things from a place of love and desire i think is is a terrible mistake i think that will that eventually comes and it and it's wonderful to have those aspects to one's life but i think we should all be in more appreciation for the fact that we are wired to be motivated when afraid and we can leverage that i'm talking about living in fear all the time but i think that we can leverage that it's what can get us out the door it's what can move us through you know tremendously difficult times so i guess i'm not out to um to turn fear into something it's not it doesn't feel good to turn stress and agitation into something it's not you know it's called stress and agitation for a reason but i don't think that it's poison i think it's the way i like to think about it again i'm calling it a lever because you know a lever you can really move things forward and then once things are going forward it's a whole different business and we could talk about that as well so it sounds like the distinction is kind of undirected fear which is what a lot of people are going through just this undirected fear their mind meandering wandering imagining worst case scenarios but not really you know to compare that to directed fear like you're really talking about you know directing your fear channeling it maybe even i don't know visualizing it would that be an opportunity would that be a practice that somebody could use to actually use their fuel as fear in their life yeah use their fear as fuel in their life yeah i do think fear can be fuel and it's very powerful fuel i think that i like the idea actually of using it as a visualization i think that if you look at the trauma literature one of the things that we know is that trauma has a has many different aspects to it but one of the hallmarks of trauma is two things really one is a confusion about who's responsible this is often the case the brain somehow gets confused about who was responsible for something terrible even though we know rationally that wasn't my fault we still it's like almost like the nervous system is trying to resolve something and we get this kind of reverberation of all the terrible feelings and the other thing that's been shown time and time again is that people really need to not hide from that experience they need to be able to confront the memory of the experience or the person of the ex you know or whatever it was and of course that should be done in a clinical setting if it's something very severe but you know we we've all probably or at least in california we've heard of you know there's like love and kindness meditation where people will do a meditation specifically aimed towards cultivating a sense of gratitude which is a beautiful and wonderful practice it's actually associated with the liberation of a different molecule serotonin which is makes us feel good about what we have serotonin is sort of the molecule satiety of of feeling like we have enough in our immediate experience dopamine and adrenaline are really about moving forward or away from things it's about not feeling comfortable where you're at either because you're craving or because you're afraid right so these uh molecules are interesting because they really do kind of separate themselves into different psychologies if you will so i could imagine taking on a practice where one sits down and focuses their mind on something that they want so craving this is not very zen sounding right you're supposed to be separate from desires but really focusing on something that you very much want or that you very much fear but is in line with something that is probably good for you and i imagine that meditation or focus or visualization would uh liberate these molecules you know the brain visualization is powerful and the brain will make efforts to take a visualization and start creating the chemicals inside that that mimic the real experience and so that's why the kind of gratitude practices are so powerful uh that's why focusing on something that we really want it feels exciting that excitement is the liberation of these molecules trying trying i mean the these cells they don't have their own mind but it's a it's a biological uh strategy to get you to move to literally to get you out of your chair and move and i think that it brings up a larger theme which is that you know the reason we have a brain is to move this thing that we call a body right animals that like us and we are animals that can move in lots of different ways run jump swim pushups dance uh i mean the variety of movements that we can do is one of the reasons we have such a big brain and these molecules they sound kind of complicated but they're actually really pretty simple dopamine is about craving motivation and pursuit epinephrine is really about agitation and endurance to get you to persist serotonin is really about feeling good about what you have you know that we hear so much about oxytocin and you know that these but oxytocin serotonin are they work together they collaborate to make you feel good when you hold your child or when you feel like maybe if you've ever had this experience of being at a with a group of friends or a party and you look around you're like i'm so blessed you know i'm so lucky to have these people right or to have this roof over my head those are those are those are molecular events and then there's a fourth neuromodulator which is acetylcholine which is really about focus but um i would say all of these molecules are applicable they can be plugged into a visualization practice this is something that could be done for you know five minutes a day of just turning off or flipping over the phone um and thinking about something in it in a very directed way and just watching how that makes you feel if it makes you feel agitated if it makes you feel good if it makes you feel a sense of desire those are those actually would be a powerful practices because it would give you a window into what's happening neurochemically and most people get this backwards they sit around and they go i don't have enough dopamine like what do i need to increase my dopamine i get this all the time what should i take to increase my dopamine and there are things you can take supplements you can take to increase dopamine and if you do that you will feel a lift this is true right there are antidepressants and other molecules you can take to increase your serotonin some people just take serotonin you can now go at least in the united states it's legal to go buy the precursor to serotonin you can do that and you will feel better about what you have temporarily but i'm always a fan unless there's a real clinical need of looking at behavioral and mental tools first then looking at the power of supplementation and nutrition which is which are real and and can be leveraged and then if there's a clinical need towards prescription drugs for which certain people they can be of real benefit but um i love the idea of a of a fear meditation yeah well it's pretty common in like the in the buddhist tradition you know they'll have like meditate on your death or in the stoic tradition they'll have you know imagine the worst case scenario and really i didn't know visualize it true i guess i've only heard the california version yeah which is go to esselen and just like and then and really enjoy the bliss of life which is a great practice but i like the uh actually i think it's important i think what you're saying is important um to for people to understand that there's there's a lot of it sounds like there's a lot of dimensionality to meditation it's not just about being relaxed and calm and in gratitude it's about confronting your inner real estate and that that's really cool and that could even be what am i missing out on in life or how am i not going to be able to serve people if i don't rise to the occasion you know there's so many aspects where you see this online sometimes there's the feeling of um i'm only gonna you know i'm only living my quoteunquote authentic self if it feels good and you know in our first like i'm i'm only going to work on stuff that feels good and a first part of our conversation was actually a lot of stuff doesn't feel good and you want to embrace that because that's how you get good at doing things so i think in that same sense meditating on stuff that doesn't feel good sometimes like one of the most motivating reoccurring dreams i have is i'm back in high school and i did great in high school but i really despised you know being there and i felt like it was very limiting and i couldn't you know study the stuff that i wanted to do and i feel like i'm back in high school but something happened and i'm like i'm still my current age right i'm like 30 38 right now and i'm 38 but at some reason i'm back in high school and i'm like holy i had all these ambitions i had all these dreams for stuff that i wanted to do and for whatever reason now i'm like struggling studying trigonometry again right and i'm going through my whole day at class in high school and i'm sitting in classes and for some version i've like been held back this is a dream or is it a visualization this is a dream okay this is a dream yeah and then because i'm also like into lucid dreaming some way through i wake up and i'm like okay i'm in my high school okay i have control wait how did i get here and i have this realization like no i'm i'm living my life i'm a grown human being i'm an adult male who has started businesses and written stuff and as a podcast and i feel so fired up that day because i just went through an entire visualization of being back in what my mind would deem to be a worst case scenario which is being back in school being held back for some sort of reason and not being able to do all the stuff that i want to and i feel energized the entire rest of the day when i actually get a chance to wake up so just another example of me personally feeling like visualizing or whether it's a dream or meditating on your death or meditating on what you would miss out on life if you can't rise to vacation or take care of your health or be there for the you know your family in the way that you want to can be a big motivator for things yeah it's interesting the um uh dreams you know of course for you know centuries people have wondered about the significance of dreams but it's very clear that in the early part of your night your sleep and your dreaming is related mainly toward physical repair of the body and toward learning of motor skills you know that there's a predominance of what they call slow wave sleep or nonrem sleep nonrapid eye movement sleep in the later half of the night toward morning you shift over to having more rem rapid eye movement sleep and there's a heavier emotional load to those dreams this is well established what's interesting is that something is written into our biology into the genome of everybody where these emotionally laden dreams in the second half of the night they're happening but the body is incapable of releasing adrenaline yeah we're also paralyzed during rem sleep we're what's called a tonic or you know we have antonio we're completely paralyzed probably so that we don't act out our dreams although no one really knows as i always say i wasn't consulted the design phase and no one else i know was either so anyone that tells you why something is the way it is should be a little bit suspect but you have these dreams that are very emotionally intense and yet you don't have adrenaline released into your system and people who are deprived of that second half of the night dreams tend to have more emotionality during their day little things seem heavy this seems to be a portion of our sleep that is a bit like trauma release therapy in a lot of trauma released therapies the idea like emdr or in just standard psychoanalysis and psychotherapy of various kinds cognitive behavioral therapy you know these are board certified approved um treatments at least in the us and and other countries as well it's all about recounting the event but trying to uncouple the event from the negative emotion and the feeling of agitation it's about really being able to get close right up you know in in front of your face with it with the experience and experiencing that but being comfortable feeling it all without doing anything about it and so in sleep we experience these this emotional fear we have fear in our second half of the night dreams but we can't act we can't do anything about it so talk about you know you know exposure therapy we get that every night now some people will wake up from those dreams and immediately the adrenaline system will kick on and it would be i mean you're just like oh my goodness that was so scary that actually shows you have a healthy adrenaline system you know that when you wake up it's really immediately available and a lot of people think oh my god that was such a dreadful dream or troubling dream that was your brain trying to uncouple the emotionality of previous days events and old events and if you again if you deprive people of that particular stage of sleep they go through life feeling emotionally weighed down by their previous experiences if you've ever been sleep deprived the littlest things can seem heavy you get two nights good sleep or three nights good sleep the whole world looks different it just looks better it feels better and so i i find it fascinating i didn't know we were gonna go down this path because we started off by talking about you know using fear as a tool to move through things and work through things and be motivated and in your description of this dream about high school it reminded me that in the sleep we have this process ongoing and for people that are having the same dream over and over it's probably the case that the body needs multiple cycles the brain needs multiple cycles of this because it's so deeply wired into us whatever it was and for people with ptsd a big part of the exposure therapies is to really bring in a safe setting in a clinical setting obviously to bring people to the point where the very worst thing they could possibly imagine is it's almost as if it's happening and then little by little the amount of adrenaline is turned down and turned down and turned down people never people might be upset to hear this but you never forget your traumatic experiences totally and that's for as you've shared before it's for a specific reason right our brain wants to hold them to file down right to you know protect us right but you can reframe the emotional component you can unweight the emotional load and this is why i think that sleep is so foundational the great work of matt walker and um and the stanford folks at the stanford sleep clinic you know and and many others of course there are many great sleep scientists out there have really unpacked this incredible period of our life we call sleep what has not happened yet and what is and something that's very important to me and my lab's mission and many other labs also is we need a taxonomy a naming system for waking states you know for sleep we have rem and slow wave sleep we know what the early night is for we know what the second half of the night is four we go through our waking life talking about things like happiness sadness depression stress anxiety and fear but it it's all pretty vague and i think one of the exciting things that's going to happen in the next 10 years or so hopefully sooner is that we're really going to start to understand what is creative work what is focus what is conversation what is pair what is bonding you know and really understand those things at a biological and psychological level to the point where we can also um i don't really like the word hack but that we will be able to uh pull apart the different components and really understand you know maybe we should i'm making this up so please don't take this as a recommendation but maybe we should all be focused on uh activities that increase our uh you know acetylcholine early in the day and then we should gradually be turning that off you know we all here don't drink caffeine past 4 pm you know and messes with your sleep well maybe there are things that we should be doing you know and for our waking states and so one of the things that excites me now is that um because of the unfortunate events of 2020 most people now are tuned into the fact that they have a brain and a body they're very much connected that we're all subject to stress that we're all grappling with things and challenged and i feel like the the universe the universality you know is that a word yeah i think so i think so maybe i didn't get someone always writes to me as like you know it corrects my my speech at some point right um the universality of of of our of our nervous system has really been been presented to us that um things like resilience and motivation and trauma and fear everybody struggles with these things everybody and anyone who seems like they don't or anyone that pretends like they don't is um has got a different neurologic issue that we can talk about in a different episode and i think really one of the big things that you've been trying to bring to that space as a whole is i think we've been doing a good job of you know when i say we i mean america primarily and other you know westernized countries of putting more attention that these things are there we don't have to hide you know everybody's going through some version of it so the answer is often we need to increase access to mental health right it kind of goes about that far and anybody who's seen what happened with the pandemic knows that our system is fragile it's been fragile fragile even before there's not enough practitioners for everybody who needs mental health access insurance at least in america is a big issue so we need other tools right and i just want to give gratitude to you because your mission from the beginning has always been free tools easily accessible that anybody can do on their own within the context of that i feel like the yes mental health access is important that's part of the equation but you're you know your through line seems to be and please jump in and correct me if i'm wrong that getting there through thoughts alone is not gonna solve maybe get help us get to the root issue right that can be part of it but we actually need to embrace the behavior you know you have this you have this quote that i heard you uh share in another um podcast and it was uh trying to control the mind with the mind is like trying to grab a fog and i think this is a fundamental thing to bring up for the folks who are listening is that when you are struggling with laziness you know lack of motivation you're stuck in fear a lot of times and you see this especially at night when people are trying to fall asleep right that their mind is so active and they're trying to tackle that through more mind right and really what you would say is that look that's not wrong but it may not get you there so let's take that scenario right sure give us the example one way if your mind is super active at night and you're trying to fall asleep you're trying to invest in your sleep and get more of it or get better quality but then everybody notices that their mind is very active what would be a way of addressing that through behavior instead of ruminating and thinking or even telling your mind like i just wish you would stop yeah so when that is very hard to control the mind with the mind and i think a simple rule that people can adopt is when your mind is not where you want it to be look to your body use the body to shift the mind it's a simple equation it's sometimes hard to do because thoughts can be so allencompassing but when your mind is not where you want it to be if you don't feel as happy or you're obsessing you need to go to a mechanical system in the body because if you do that you'll shift the chemicals that are released in your brain in a way that will allow you to regain control of the steering wheel so there are a couple things that can do that immediately the most basic one and the simplest one is going to be with respiration with breathing so breathing and the neurons that control breathing are so interesting because they are constantly working they work reflexively all the time they're working right now if you're live and you're listening to this you they're working but unlike a lot of aspects of our brain body connection we can grab a hold of it immediately and and start tinkering with it like i can't say right now hey start digesting faster andrew you know or tell my intestines hey you know slow down digestion or i can't make my heart rate speed up just by telling it to but i can slow down or speed up my breathing if i want to so it lies at this bridge between the conscious and the unconscious mind and i don't say this from any point or stance of philosophy this is physiology so if your mind is not where you want it to be whether or not you're trying to sleep or work or focus or anything i'm a big fan of this physiological sigh which was discovered by physiologists in the 1930s it's a double inhale through the nose and a long exhale that follows the exhale can be done through the mouth or through the nose if you're one of these people who can't breathe through your nose you could do this all through your mouth so it's just to inhale and then inhale again even if you're just sneaking in a little bit more air and then long exhale the physiological size known to physiologists and neuroscientists as a way to offload a lot of what's called carbon dioxide and it immediately produces a heightened sense of calm or reduced sense of stress and alertness it's not going to put you to sleep right away but i'll just do it um just by way of example so people can see since it always looks funny to breathe and you know by example for some reason and no you don't have to close your eyes in order to breathe you can breathe your eyes open so it's just right so it's inhale inhale long exhale this physiological side is known to reinflate these little sacs in the lungs called the aviola the lungs and then when you exhale it offloads a lot of carbon dioxide and that immediately reduces your levels of stress now why am i recommending this well if your mind is churning on something maybe you're just obsessing maybe you're not just maybe you're not really stressed maybe you're sad but when you use respiration to kind of wedge in between your conscious and unconscious life suddenly you realize that using something that's purely mechanical your lungs air carbon dioxide your mind shifts as well and there are a lot of studies now um the best of which i think have been done by jack feldman who's a professor at ucla who's worked his entire career basically on the physiology of breathing and the mind the brain shifts their states of mind shift the chemistry of the brain starts to shift but this physiological size more about grabbing a hold of the steering wheel again that's what it's really about and then it's about what you do next so if you're having a hard time falling asleep there are a couple things you can do one is to do exhale emphasized breathing and not try to fall asleep just focus on doing big inhales and but even longer exhales doesn't matter if it's through the nose or the mouth exhales tend to long extended exhales tend to shift the body into more what we call parasympathetic states more relaxed states parasympathetic is just fancy language for the system of the body that controls calmness it promotes calmness think of it like a break okay there are two ways to slow down a car one is to come off the accelerator the other is to push on the brake so long exhales are like pushing on the brake okay now it's expected and it's totally normal that the brain will continue to ruminate if you're having trouble sleeping after you've done that and really what i just described probably takes about five to thirty seconds i'm not talking about an extended breath work protocol just a physiological side to remind yourself oh wait i'm in control of this system that seems to be taking kind of going off the rails on its own or that i can't seem to control the extended exhales tend to bring more calm to the system i'm a big fan of using a tool um to shift the body into sleep or sleeplike states insomnia is terrible people trying to sleep when they can't is absolutely maddening better to try and encourage the body to relax in in general and see if you can fall asleep later not try and force yourself into sleep so uh the two practices that work best for this as one goes by the yoga nidra many people have probably i heard it last time yeah by the way can i interject about yoganitra i don't know if you and uh and your team have looked at it but if you look at some of the top yoga nature videos and you go down to the comments uh like some of the first comments are andrew huberman brought me here and then other people replying back and saying yep i'm here for the same reason so that's the words getting out there and a lot of people are watching these youtube videos oh that's very gratifying to hear yeah i have no business relationship to yoga nidra has been developed you know centuries before i was even born means yoga sleep you just lie down you listen to one of these scripts they're available on youtube as free you know totally cost free um they tend to walk you through a uh a set of visualizations a set of breathing protocols that essentially turn the mind off right this is the uh it essentially accomplishes what a couple stiff alcoholic drinks will do which will also turn off your forebrain the promise has other issues that go with it and many people who use alcohol to try and calm down have a rebound increase in anxiety i can always spot anxious people and people that have chronic anxiety by the way that they drink and the way that they need a drink anyone tells me i need a drink i i know they have they are not good at regulating their nervous system i'm not using i'm not saying that in a disparaging way but it says to me it's somebody that is sort of like saying i need a i need an uber driver i'm like you don't really know how to drive you know or like it's it's it's a you know if you need one right right if you need a chauffeur right it's nice to have one sometimes right but if you need one there's a problem right so yoga nidra is a wonderful practice the other thing that's wonderful and that now there's a lot of good data on is hypnosis so one of the things i've become increasingly interested in is hypnosis because i have a collaborator um by the name of david spiegel he's an md md phd he's a our associate chair of psychiatry at stanford and he's used hypnosis uh to great effect for smoking cessation pain management breast cancer outcomes are greatly improved by the sorts of hypnosis he's done with his patients and for sleep and other things and there's a wonderful resource that i'm happy to point people to it's a free resource which is an app for android and apple called reverie reveri you can go to reveriecom download that it's a hypnosis app where you can hear david's voice he has a very hypnotic voice um and he walks you through you can pick a hypnosis for sleep or for pain management they've even got some now to improve focus for work hypnosis is a very interesting practice because it incorporates a lot of the same things we've been talking about a shift in breathing a shift in it involves a lot of stuff with the eyes which is my labs interesting when you talk about why they you know why they have you look up and try and close your eyes and all this stuff that's not that's not magician stuff it's not sorcery it has to do with the relationship between the eyes and the socalled autonomic nervous system in any case hypnosis is a wonderful tool because it shifts the brain and body very quickly into states into desired states states of focus states of relaxation states of reduced craving etc and a lot of people are afraid of hypnosis i wish it had a different name because clinical hypnosis is nothing like stage hypnosis you are in control it's about you shifting over what's called the default mode network this kind of the idle you know a car a transmission that's screwed up well if you get in your car and you turn it on all of a sudden it's redlining just standing still you know that the rpms are way up then there's a problem with the transmission the hypnosis is really about adjusting that idle level bringing about a sense of focus and a sense of control over your nervous system so i would say yoga first physiological side that should be people's anchor point just pull back into the control over your your nervous system and your mind once you've done that you can tell yourself because you have that you've you've intervened with what felt like something that was out of your control your thoughts at that point some long exhales breathing for maybe you know 20 seconds or so no big deal and then i would reach to either a yoga knee just script or a hypnosis script and of course there are things that people can take you know drinking too much caffeine late in the day can make it hard to fall asleep um i personally and this is just me you know if i don't have enough starchy carbohydrates late in the day i have a hard time falling asleep because they are precursors to tryptophan and serotonin so i'm not a big some people on very low carbohydrate diets struggle to fall asleep so i push my carbohydrates toward later in the day for instance and then there are supplements that many people find beneficial i'm personally not a big fan of melatonin because people tend to take far too much of it relative to the normal physiological levels and it has some other issues but things like magnesium by glycinate or magnesium 3na theanine apogenin which is chamomile tea but if you don't want to do the supplement thing and i fully respect if people are averse to that you know pills and that sort of thing you know chamomile tea is great it has something called apogenin which turns on for you aficionados out there it turns on chloride channel system in the in the forebrain it basically helps shut down thinking to go to sleep it mellows you out it's a real effect and so there are a number of things that that people can do and um and sleeping is a skill you get good at it do you need blackout curtains well some people you know some people have thin eyelids some people have thick eyelids you know i have thin eyelids i mean i you know light goes on even with my eyes closed and it like wakes me up some people nope no problem so sleep masks blackout curtains i don't think people should become obsessive about sleep what you want to do is develop some sleep practices and the core ones are recognizing early in the evening that you're shifting towards sleep and starting to prepare for it the same way you would prepare for school or work or a workout and not thinking that you can just go go go go and then have a perfect night's sleep and um you know so there those are the things always behaviors first then in my opinion then look to nutrition supplementation and then if someone has a real clinical need and they they should see a sleep specialist and there are drugs that will help you know help people sleep but i i think the vast majority of people that are taking prescription drugs to sleep are don't need them or put differently could achieve different if not better effects doing other things well well said you know we didn't chat at all about sort of origin story for you last time when you're on the podcast we went right into things and i have a question that kind of relates a little bit to your origin story which i had the chance to prepare and you know listen to a little bit before this podcast so you were talking about the body as one of the vehicles to focus the mind now i know you've shared in the past that you're you know uh you grew up in a household um and and i won't go into everything but at one point in time you know parents split and the household was a little bit unstructured yeah right you were kind of like there was no structure there was no structure there was no one there there was no one there like the truth is there was no one there and i look i love my parents and they did you know an amazing job it would under trying circumstances doing the best they could with what they had and but yeah there were periods of time in which i was completely feral which was fun and scary and you know and uh if nothing else taught me that you know i have uh some internal resources i can always rely on totally and so i want to talk about a little bit of that internal resources you know you from what i understand school is like there was not really a lot of interest i think you eventually got kicked out of high school i had to leave two high schools yeah i did graduate eventually yep you know thank you wrote ashley i mean there were other students that helped me learn like there were a few i just mentioned somebody who like would sit with me and like help me try and understand my homework just enough to i mean i was a dreadful student this is not a look high school students work hard it's so much easier to leverage your plasticity early in life you have this gift of plasticity use it i don't you definitely do not want to try and come back from the back of the pack you know it's not no fun being the caboose yeah it's tough and not everybody ends up making it through statistically you know people who are in the back of the pack tend to stay there and life becomes tougher and stereotypes against them and stuff but again going to this idea of working through the body to kind of focus the mind um it sounds like from what i've read from your story there's a couple sort of key moments you saw you started seeing a therapist and that therapist was i think the one who gave you the book by john cabot zen and i want to come back to that in a second but another one was it seems like there was i don't know if it was the same guy or somebody else that really got you into fitness right fitness working out and that seems to have been from the way that i was understanding your story one of the things that got you to start to focus in and channel a little bit of this energy that was there is that an accurate way to it's very accurate um yeah the guy's name was bob peters um he was a uh a absolute hulk of a human being he was just a scene he was our football coach i didn't play football um i was pretty skeins dude yeah i was pretty skinny kid um i was real skinny kid skateboarder i was fragile i kept breaking my bones this kind of thing so i initially went to him uh because i want to get stronger i couldn't do a pullup i was just i was just weak and also i was interested in a girl and like i heard her previous boyfriend to play football or something i think it was that kind of like high school you know young male insecurity thing i was like situps and my pushups and things like that um and you know he taught me that basically the body has this amazing response system that if you give it the proper stimulus it will respond and i think so i started doing some weight training and running i for me at first it was running crosscountry and then i started weight training and those two things really taught me that there there wasn't always a direct and linear relationship between effort and reward effort and outcome but with physical fitness it's about as good as it gets right i you know it's very hard i i could under you know i could sympathize with a student who's you know getting grades in school and you don't really see how that's setting you up for something later and if you're somebody who's challenged in academics it can be very hard to think you know why should i even fight for a c plus why should i just you know absolutely destroy myself for you know an a minus on this subject that i have no interest in and um the reason to do it is because you're training the mind to learn and yes you're developing skills but you're really training the mind to learn and i don't think that has to be done in the context of academics although i do believe that cultivating the mind and the body is is good and i wish i'd done more of it when i was younger but what bob peters taught me was that if i was consistent with my training that my body would respond and it did you know over time i got stronger and i learned how to take care of my body i learned how to push myself through pain you know physical pain i i guess i've always had a sort of weird relationship to pain i've i wouldn't say i have a high pain threshold i feel like i'm the guy that stubs his toe and i'm like i scream but then it goes flat i have this very like steep inflection of pain and then it disappears and i learned that so for me pain is like a big wall of fire but it's a very thin wall and i and that for me has been very helpful because everything that's been challenging for me i try and imagine as that kind of thin wall of very very intense fire it just doesn't last but it's very intense and so i'm just i expect it so physical pursuits i think are wonderful and i do believe that everyone should have some relationship to the physical world and their physical body regardless of abilities and so that was the entry point i'm very grateful to him he was also he was an amazing guy i give this picture of this football coach but he also um he was an incredible classical pianist he taught himself how to play the piano he also um he was a stayathome dad for a while on a bet with his wife um he actually wrote the he wrote that's the television thing which eventually became the screenplay to mr mom i know i have mentioned that before and people said no it wasn't bob peters look it up it was bob peters it eventually got sold to john hughes but he lost a bet with his wife she said you couldn't do what i do and he was like you know so they did the swap in the 70s which was rare raised three kids i mean he's an amazing human being did a lot of work with atrisk kids and so i think having an example of somebody that was physically like physically very robust who also was cultivating his mind um was a great example for me and so you know i think oftentimes it just takes the right role model and um and i'm a big believer that especially nowadays with everything being online that we can internalize role models you know we don't need to know the person or have a coach or somebody like that i mean that's what's so wonderful about these people like david goggins and rich roll and joe rogan and and you know and and mark and you and all these people that are out there that are sharing is that you don't have to have a football coach or a friend or a neighbor that's going to point you to something you can really latch on to an ethos and make it work for you and no and you know in fairness and in reality no one person is uh you know has all the answers you look to people as a i've always imagined a committee in my life there's like a table in my mind and i have very i have a committee and i take advice from those people some of them have no idea who i am i've never met them but i try and internalize their ethos around certain things in a way that serve me and um the relationship to the physical to just bring it back to that is wonderful because what you start to realize is that the mind follows the body very readily and i you know the mind is weak i know people are out there saying the mind is strong it can do it you can force the body to do it the mind is very labile the brain would be much happier or perfectly happy digesting nonsense all day long than doing nothing try sit doing nothing for five minutes try scrolling instagram for five minutes it's it's night and day right the body is powerful in its ability to shift the mind where you want it to go and that's why i'm such a fan of getting into into action forward action that's why i'm such a fan of using respiration as this bridge between the conscious and the unconscious and i i believe in thought and thinking and hard problem solving too i mean i i define an intellectual as somebody that can really appreciate and understand something at multiple levels of detail not you know um so but i think it's all intellectualism on its own you know just being in your head is a terrible terrible place to live you should try i believe each day or every few days to get into a state of wordlessness outside of sleep i'm a big believer in this that running not listening to audiobooks or anything but just letting your mind drift is the substrate that allows it's the precursor i should say that allows you to then sit down and do very focused work if you're having trouble focusing chances are you're you're focusing too much you know that's basically what's happening if you're having trouble focusing chances are you're you're focusing too much in a distributed way it's like an appetite if you're just snacking all the time it's just the meal doesn't taste quite as good so running um any form of turning the brain conscious thought deliberate thought off will allow you to do incredibly deep work after that it's but the mistake is just constantly digesting information and so i think we need to be more structured about our um waking states but the body in my opinion should be the entry point it sounds like in addition to the body directing the mind there was also this deep connection with that you learned from this mentor who got you into into working out and fitness there was also a true relationship with effort and reward right you you work out even with a successful workout you know you're not going to start to see yourself putting on maybe muscle right away but just the joy that comes from putting in a good workout whereas previously and i think a lot of parents you know who are listening to this podcast sometimes try to figure out you know how can i create drives or intrinsic motivation for my my child and a lot of school at least back you know when when you and i were in school too it was much more common it's changing a little bit now was you kind of have to take the authority's word for the fact that the reward is going to come down the rhine yeah and it doesn't always work and it doesn't always work no and you know and growing up where i grew up you know i also saw a lot of people who went after that carrot and then they you know for extrinsic reasons and did very well and then later in life were very resentful very unhappy i think they still did quote unquote better in life because they they position themselves to have options so um we can't deny that that it buys you options you know i i guess i'm revealing some of my kind of hokey little secrets here but for me they've been very powerful so i have a white board in my gym at home and um but i used to just keep this in my notebook in the days when i went went to places to work out so i i write down before every workout i write enjoy training hard because i had another mentor later while i was in college who he said you know he didn't say enjoy your training he said enjoy training hard so i've developed this relationship where i just love training hard i i love the feeling of failure i actually really like failed repetitions i like failing i like finding out where i'm limited um because i know that that's the the road to the next you know next segment of progress and so do you think that came from like early skateboard board culture you know doing tricks and trying it and knowing that you you know you expect that you're gonna fall did that come then or did that come later on in life yeah i'm trying to think about you know to be in full disclosure skateboarding was a really important part of my upbringing and that was my that was my family basically i basically just was part of this big pack of kids and uh there were no parents and we were all feral and uh we had a lot of fun and unfortunately you know a lot of them met kind of a you know sad fate some of them did incredibly well but i've great rep some people might see skateboarding as just those like clicky clackety things going down the sidewalk but there's a there's a whole world of that that's selfregulated um that i have deep respect for but uh in full disclosure i wasn't one of the good skateboarders my body wasn't strong i just that's why i started working out because i was getting hurt all the time and but skateboarding is a good example of where it's effort effort effort fail fail fail like you know you're you're getting beat up you're basically beating yourself up until you get the successful you know right away and that is incredible i don't think i cultivate it there for me it was really in college starting in my second year because i i also had to leave college for poor performance and other reasons none of which i'm proud of at all but when i finally decided to just bite down and really do it i mean i experienced so much physical agitation um and i just but i realized that the information was in the books like it was there so it's not like i had to go it was complicated sometimes to understand or remember but that there's nothing simpler than it something being presented to you it doesn't get any easier than that and that was hard so but i just got good at restricting my desire to get up um from my chair i got good at um just pushing through i also have to say that a big part of working through stress and agitation is giving up on the immediate rewards of some of the social stuff you know those were pretty isolated years for me i had to not go to as many parties as i would have liked i wasn't one of the cool kids you know because i was studying all the time i was working out all the time so you have to be good at dealing with peer pressure i mean if you want to be successful in life you definitely either want to surround yourself with people who are also ambitious in the things that you enjoy and love and want to be good at sports or school that really helps i did not have those friends around me at that time or you have to be very good at pushing off peer pressure and that will isolate you i guess you know they call that the empty elevator syndrome you know if you hang around with people that don't care about something and you're doing a lot of it they're going to give you a lot of flack about that i guess i'm sort of orienting this towards young people but at any stage of life if you're taking steps to better yourself you're going to find yourself pretty lonely for a little while so i got i would spend all day saturday at this park near where i um was in college i would get myself a couple of hamburgers because i liked them i would go to innout burger get a couple double doubles and i'd sit under this tree and study all day long then i'd sleep wake up study some more sleep i go back and you know that's saturday night in college you're supposed to be out having fun and then sunday morning i'd do a 12 mile run so there's a sicko you know and i slow run i want to be clear so that's it occasionally i would go to parties and i'd enjoy myself but i started to find that um i could predict that if i kept these behaviors up that i was going to pass a lot of my peers and competition is something that's interesting i'm not an inherently competitive person i'm not one of these people at the party like if you play ping pong with me i'd sooner let you win than try and beat you like why let's just like rally let's just play i have friends that are really competitive i've never been an inherently competitive person with anybody else but um if you start cultivating a sense that you you have a goal and you nothing's going to prevent you from getting to that because you are willing to put in the hours that's a powerful feeling and um it can be taken too far i've been told my college girlfriend said you know i created a monster that's what she said you know because she was always encouraging me to work harder and then when i finally did it it went pretty extreme but look it's always easier to throttle back than to try and you know make it from behind and if you're somebody who hasn't invested a lot in any of these domains like academics or in health or in fitness the important thing is to is to just get started and get consistent you know i i think that even if somebody is just walking five days a week consistently just walking right it's the cons consistency is what what pays off and i think it pays off for a different reason than we think sometimes we want to see the physical or the financial results right away but i think a big part of it is that you're training your nervous system we have these things called central pattern generators these are neurons that are in our spinal cord and brain stem that generate repetitive movements and the brain loves to load central pattern generators with work because then the mind can think about other things and so a lot of the the challenge of studying or taking on a fitness program or something like that it's because it requires so much deliberate forebrain activity do i drink the coffee then do i do it then do i do a workout at this time do i study this am i doing it right all that constant rumination right but once you just do if you just decide i'm gonna do it regularly that's a nonnegotiable part then a lot of that gets handed over to central pattern generators and it frees up a lot of energy it frees up neural energy and it frees up your ability to think about other things while you walk if that's what you want to do i want to just like highlight something you said because i think this is going to be a big aha moment for people is that you know we're constantly seeking freedom in our life but actually you can get like structure is one of the best ways to create that freedom like think about it you know you make the joke and say that you guys are a bunch of like frail animals you had all the freedom in the world you could do anything at that time but that wasn't necessarily getting you maybe the results that you wanted and through creating structure there was another type of freedom that you opened up in in life and i think that in anything that people want to pursue health focus as we talked about a bunch in your last podcast episode a business goal whatever you want to do what does that structure look like that you can bring to your world and not only to create results but to open up freedom into not having to having to think about it in a way yeah no absolutely and i've to this day i struggle with structure especially as more if if people out there think that the moment you start achieving some success that things are going to get easier it gets worse it there are more opportunities and therefore your structure gets disrupted more email more texts come in more amazing possible relationships and places to eat and things to do it actually starts to undermine the whole process if you're not careful and and that's coming from somebody who you know i'm fortunate to not have substance abuse tendencies and things that sort but i still have to i have a list and now i make it every day because when i just put it next to me and i didn't write it out it didn't work but like it literally starts dog walk number one get sun i mean like really basic stuff i mean i basically have to hand hold myself in the same way that um i talk about protocols on podcasts and that we're talking about here i i talk to myself that way as well um you know get sunlight then i do a 90 minute work block which means i use the program freedom on the computer no internet no phone i turn off the phone i put it in my car sometimes it's really bad i mean the phone is it's a it's such a pull asked me for some code to get into something and then i think i need the phone next thing i'm doing something else so 90 minute work block but what's beautiful is that the nervous system and i don't know the underlying basis of this but the nervous system has this feature to it where when we take the chaos of choice and we restrict ourselves to one of those choices you get a neurochemical payoff and it comes in the form of dopamine and acetylcholine acetylcholine is really about a spotlight of focus and here i i want in fairness i i'm a big fan i've been reading a lot of cal newport's work deep work a world without email um i've never met him but i love his books and he talks some people call it flow but what um you know and people are familiar with flow being engaged in an activity that's challenging but there's something about activities that are forced restriction to one particular focus right so i'm gonna write for 90 minutes or i'm going to um think for 90 minutes or i'm just gonna walk the dog i live in an area now where i don't get reception on my dog walks at first it was excruciating i love it now it's like i just walked the dog and there's morning sorry i have a bulldog he does not like to walk so i'm like i gotta get back and i'm frustrated and i know and it's hilarious right because i noticed myself and the way that my my um tripwire to agitation is so slight i'm like one of these people i can just in a second i'm aggravated because it's not happening as quickly and so i've learned to make the whole walk a process of me just like recognizing these features of myself and my bulldog costello just plods a lot he could care less right so the walk is very it's only about walking the dog and the the email if it's email is only about checking email right and there's something valuable to this and i think the brain loves this when we give it this and the brain unfortunately is also happy to just take a smorgasbord of you know pseudorandom thoughts and actions all day every day but there's something so deeply satisfying about focus and um i think we could all uh benefit from doing more of that it's just so hard to do and i'm not an antiphone guy i'm from silicon valley i use the phone i'm addicted to my phone i admit it i'm addicted to my phone but i'm trying really hard to cultivate a different relationship to it because i think that in now that that's 2021 i think looking back phones we've had them for about 10 years there are so many examples of ways in which they erode our best relationship to life so many ways that i don't think we should get rid of them but i think we really need to start being conscious of of the ways in which they are eroding our productivity our creativity our relationships and i don't have any obvious answers to this i just have tools that i use um and that i've found to be of benefit but i think in the next five years we are going to see a shift toward people really moving away from from phones in um as much as we use them now yeah it almost seems like in our evolutionary history we have to be more of a student of focus now whereas life's circumstances would naturally pull us towards lifting that weight of focus a little bit on our own you still had to apply effort but it's almost like trying to get good sleep now with a lot of sounds going in the background or somebody every so often coming and waking you up and saying hey are you okay and you're like i'm sleeping like i just you know that's tons of interference so it's almost like if you're not a student of focus today i mean most of my friends that have created you know pretty large companies always tell me and you know we have this men's group that we meet up regularly and we we chat they say you know it is definitely feels tougher to start a business today than even 10 years ago with the amount of distractions that that are fighting for our attention yeah and there are different categories of people out there and i want to be respectful the fact that not everyone's trying to you know build and create but i would say if you're a creator if you if you want to build something business or write or music or sport or anything i'll tell you i know i'm fortunate to know a good number of very successful people if you're a creator you're you have to always ask yourself are you playing offense are you playing defense are you just bench warming and most of the activities on the phone not all of them are in the defense or bench warming category if you're a content creator you want to be a content creator you absolutely have to take the effort to create space in order to produce content and that's going to require agitation and loneliness and frustration for brief periods of time i'm not saying about for years of your life i mean for ten minutes while you're not tending to the voices and the things that need you and yeah they need you and they will have anxiety and you will have yours and but people if you're going to produce content you need that to create that space the other thing is that the the phone is wonderful right you can turn on a reverie hypnosis script and you know just because it's there and you can use it so i want to acknowledge its utility it's a wonderful tool but the other the other thing is that young people have integrated the phone into their nervous system in their lives in ways that other people haven't so i would say that for people that are listening to this now in 2021 and they are 20 years or younger chances are the phone isn't going to feel as intrusive as it will for somebody who's older than that just because of the way that when the nervous system wires up like i've had a 14 year old niece and the phone is just wired into her relationships so if you take away her phone she suffers in a way that maybe doesn't justify taking away the phone so this is going to be an interesting kind of generational conversation but if you have a hard time not turning off your phone for an hour to do focused work or 90 minutes if that's a real challenge that's a great invitation to start working through some of the neural circuits for what we call no go so i do this now i i'm revealing all my little weird uh quirks but they're grounded in neuroscience so um we have circuits that are called go circuits these are if you want to know that if you want to look them up there's circuits of the basal ganglia and they're involved anytime we make a decision to make a behavior like reach out i just picked up the bottle put it down deliberately and then we have no go circuits these are ones that suppress behavior and they've done a lot of beautiful experiments where you can create a a video game or something where people have the impulse to make a choice in order to score points in a certain amount of time and sometimes you have to go and sometimes you have to no go you have to avoid movement and suppressing movement takes effort right and all you have to do is uh experience a social gathering and see one person pull out their phone and you just notice everyone start pulls out their phone that tells you it's been handed over to central pattern generators i don't think it's conscious i don't think people are like oh exciting i'm gonna look at my phone it's literally just now it's socially cued so it's sort of like someone wipes the side of their nose like maybe they got something and then the other then you know people will just start doing this is like human behavior we mimic each other subconsciously subconscious so we do it with the phone so i have this thing where every i don't believe that we have as much attention deficit as people think there's about 10 percent of the population that probably has legitimate attention deficit it's getting worse and the numbers are creeping towards 12 15 and 20 in adults as well because of the phone just to be totally honest so this morning i experienced this i went for a run i was listening to music and i i wanted to see if i had reception and check something on my phone and so i will i have a rule i do 25 times a day this is just my order sense of order 25 times a day i try and suppress a desire to take an action and i'll tell you it's excruciating i wanted to do it so badly i don't even know why it's just i'm trying to override some circuitry that to just look when i have reception to just look at my phone see where text messages or whatever direct messages so i get to the car i was like whoa i made it do i look now and i thought don't do it don't do it and i'm thinking i should do it i should do it i sit there for about a minute this is crazy i'm a grown man 45 years old right i should drive home it's not but i didn't do it and i was like this feels really good so what i'm trying to do now is train myself to not be reflexive about the phone and i think that requires a conscious effort eventually it'll become more automatic in the same way that reaching for it became automatic so these nogo circuits are require a lot of energy a lot of work but we can train them up and that's what's cool and that's neuroplasticity the brain's nervous system's ability to change in response to deliberate focus and experience we're the only species as far as we know that can rewire our nervous system deliberately in this way if other animals do it like my dog costello if he tries to do this he doesn't do it very well but humans can do this but the agitation of you know the no go effort is i wanna bold face and underline twice the word effort it is supposed to feel challenging so you know i don't know that it's necessary for some people might be very good at this i think people who are older 50 60 they're probably better at this because their nervous system didn't incorporate the phone into the their world quite as much but you know again i don't want to demonize the phone but i think learning to control one's behavior with the phone is going to be the the distinction between those that are successful i really believe this and those that are not and there will be a range there it's not black and white right it's not a stark contrast there'll be a number of shades of gray in between but the better you are at controlling your relationship to distraction and to these impulses that draw you off track the more you're going to be able to produce things also the better you will be for relationships of all kinds you know there are certain people they're more clued into this than others but everybody appreciates like someone who's very present i have a friend that's why you introduce them to any of my girlfriends in the past and you know that they walk away i was always he's a really good friend but i was always a little envious of him because they always go he has the best presence and you know what it is is his phone never comes out of his pocket and when you're with him he's actually just talking to you it's not that complicated or he's not even thinking about their phone you know some people don't have their phone out but you can tell that they're exactly thinking or they're waiting for the next moment exactly and i think what you said is it's so beautiful because it's not just present on the micro our own individual relationships our relationship with our work but it's also present on the macro you know there was this really great harvard business review article we'll link to it in the show notes where it said you know what's the difference between people that people and companies right so personal brands and companies that get a little bit successful why are people who get a little bit successful why don't they go on to become uber successful like extremely successful when they already had that momentum and a big part of it for both people and organizations so anybody who's running teams is distractions as you get more successful as you mentioned earlier more opportunities come more reasons to not focus as a human level in our relationships but also as a company level you take on every opportunity instead of doing what got you there in the first place which was doubling down on that focus so whether you run a team whether this is in your household whether it's just your own mind for your relationships for your own mental health focus is deeply linked with your own sense of contentment joy and success however you define it right i absolutely agree account i'm still not through it all the way but cal newport's book a world without email talks about this i think he uses the phrase a hyperactive hive mind in companies this was adopted in the last 20 years or so where it just seems like the more is better mentality more interactions being better and and it's been shown and he you know gives data to support this that over and over again the ability to just drop into focused work or work in small teams you know i'm very blessed now you know my podcast team is a wonderful group of four people more or less um having a small team is really beneficial if you look in military special operations they're very aware of limiting team size in terms of you know operators that work in groups of you know four to six to eight you can do incredible outsized things when a small group like that when things get too big it just uh it just wicks out in and that's also when problems start arising that's that's when people start making mistakes uh oversight is a is one source of that fatigue is another and you know i guess it is all to say that learning to cultivate a a life of focus and i should say it should be produ the way to support that is to have components of your day of wordlessness and defocus i do want to emphasize that because it's not about waking up and from morning till till night being ultra focused right i don't i don't i don't do the make my bed first thing i admit it i sometimes like it happens midday okay all right i wouldn't make it in the military but we knew that already anyway so the you know that it's about being in in recognition of where you're at and focused and dropping in deeply for certain portions of the day but i also have a deliberate decompress time of my day right i take 30 minutes a day and i either take a nap or i do a yoga nidra or i just let my mind go but that does mean not mindless scrolling although i do some mindless scrolling too i allow myself that but having periods of the day where you let the mind defocus and just kind of drift in the same way that your mind drifts a bit during sleep that is what allows you to focus so it very intensely afterward or on a consistent basis so it's not about being in a total animal from morning till night and then just expecting to switch you know switch off the thinking and go right to sleep it's about for me if they're really two blocks two 90minute blocks one early in the day and one later in the day where i commit to doing really focused work twice a day and i have to fight tooth and nail to create the space for those and to make sure it happens and if i and i fail a lot you know if something gets in the way and i don't do that i um i just try and get back on track as quickly as possible i don't bring my phone i put my phone on airplane mode when i'm training and doing any kind of physical work now because it's just too distracting i want to go back to something you shared earlier which was this idea of a committee you know you have these people in your life whether you know them and some people you don't know that are kind of uh seth godin sometimes says like you don't always need a mentor but you can have heroes in your life right people that you look up to who would be some other people that are on that uh that committee of yours you know people that you kind of like look to even if you don't know them personally for uh guidance uh inspiration or a reminder of sort of that intrinsic quality inside of you that you've seen in them yeah so the um someone i keep in mind a lot is my my graduate advisor a woman by the name of barbara chapman she's an excellent scientist she passed away unfortunately too young breast cancer 50 but i think about barbara a lot because her relationship to work was really special she really understood what it was to be what we call a serious scientist there's a there's a phrase that scientists use like are they a serious scientist which is really about trying to seek truth you know there's always an element of getting the paper published getting the grant funded packaging things in a way that's digestible that that's an important and vital part of the scientific process of any process really but she had this um way in which she held the like the pursuit of facts of truth as holy above everything else so i definitely keep barbara in mind because there is a way in which we can start to delude ourselves into thinking um you know that our ideas are are strong when you know have we really thought through all the alternatives here have we really done that but also just the purity of it you know just in in a life of of inquiry or of any kind just to really try and get close to why i started doing it i started doing science because i was curious about how we work in the mind and body it was just genuine curiosity and so i keep her in mind a lot i keep um i have a good friend uh pat dossett who was uh in the seal teams and then got out and um he and blake mykoski who started tom's shoes right had this company made for that i'm on the advisory for uh and pat i think of a lot he's a close i'm fortunate to have him as a close friend because his um he the way he does the little things is really impressive he's always five minutes early always five minutes early i struggle with punctuality he's always five minutes early he also is very good about the the presence thing like um about what he's doing he's doing he's also very good he's probably always five minutes early because he always leaves when he needs to leave this is something i actually learned from him um when it's time to go you just say thanks i'm i'm out like not like none of the long trailing goodbyes that's which is something i'm guilty of but also i i really appreciate his ethics and he's somebody who thinks very deeply about why one started something and staying on that so those two and if i and of course there are so many amazing examples out there of impressive people but they're the ones i think about a lot lately in terms of really trying to um stay close to the the central cord of why i you know why i'm here and what i'm trying to do which is trying to discover and share knowledge in ways that are useful to people um and you know i'd be remiss i i'm sort of laughing in advance this i'm chuckling but i i think about my bulldog costello way too much i talk about him all the time now on my podcast another podcast but i think about him a lot because and the way he approaches life because you know dogs are incredible because you see tremendous variation in one species dogs of different temperaments and body sizes and behaviors and his temperament is unique it's it's stubborn and joyful and all but like there's something about stubbornness he's so stubborn and it's teaching me actually to be more stubborn about like i know what i like and i know why i'm here and what i'm doing it took me a long time to find that but i'm starting to become more i'm trying to internalize costello more so he definitely has a spot at the committee table um and and bulldogs are hedonists too he loves sleep and the way he eats food is in it's insane he can devour like a huge bowl of food so he's that so i'm actually trying to cultivate a little bit more of his like like love for food and love for sleep and like really enjoy what it is i'm doing and i'm also starting to become more and more stubborn but maybe that's just aging there's a there's a short little book by eckhart tolle author power of now and stuff and um it's called guardians of being and it's basically about animals beautiful title it's about animals man is it i'm gonna read i'm gonna get this book today dogs cats primarily but it's basically how as human beings you know we we struggle so much with our mind pulling us in so many different directions and for some people they're it's a lifelong battle they feel it really shouldn't be a battle but it's a lifelong battle with their mind and not getting space and sort of awareness and inside of there it's like really talking about how pets can be one of the greatest reminders about presence in our lives and reflecting back upon us the things that we might need or or benefit from oh my god and i just thought of that no i brought it up thank you uh i'm a huge and i mean i'm obsessed with animals and um i've heard of eckhart tolle i know a little bit of his stuff my sister who's a therapist is obsessed with his work and really loves it i um i'm definitely going to get this book and check it out because i think animals have a lot to teach us about how we work because their nervous systems i've looked at a lot of them admittedly their nervous systems are simpler and what you find in simpler nervous systems is that a couple core sets of operations are extremely well honed so the bulldog is the bulldog because their brain is organized that way a cent hound or retriever behaves that way because of the way their nervous system is organized and human beings are gifted with this potential to have so many different behaviors or learn music or not learn basketball or not other animals don't get that set of choices and i think it leads to a confusion about who we are and what we're about we are about variety and choice and optionality and that's wonderful on the one hand but i think if we want to understand what the extreme version of any kind of expression would be of of stubbornness of um glee of uh creativity i think animals can reveal that to us because they are the more focused honed down example of the way a nervous system could be built and so i i'm excited to read this book you know you just uh that reminds me that i've heard you share in other interviews that you were kind of obsessed with animals and animal movement growing up and also just recently you did a whole series on on kind of movement and in one of them movement muscle growth you know giving a lot of different you know tips you talk about posture right what's important for people to understand when it comes to exactly this topic that we're chatting about which is movement function the body controlling the brain what's important for people to understand when it comes to this topic of posture yeah um and always when the word posture is spoken then everyone starts noting their posture i have a friend um kelly starrett who does a lot of work in the um is a company called the ready state they've done a lot of work in like physical rehabilitation sports performance and this kind of thing um he's a tremendous athlete he and his wife julia are both really amazing athletes and he always says they're big on the standing desk thing they've got kids they've been putting doing a bunch of work get standing desks into schools but he also makes this comment that you know we weren't meant to sit all day but we also weren't meant to stand all day so you know the idea is that we should be able to move in a lot of different dimensions and feel comfortable doing that um i mean the movement is a huge discussion but um there are a couple things that relate to posture that that are interesting one thing that i've learned from kelly and that's certainly been true for me and in terms of longevity and in sport and just making me feel better all around is that usually when we have pain someplace that the solution lies in doing some work and strengthening the the musculature above and below that pain so we tend to focus like on the knee when it's really like like you know maybe you need to do a lot of like tibialis work or you know hip work because the knee injury is a reflection of the way that the body moves or fails to move on the whole so one of the things that i've become conscious of is in looking at the literature is that you know things that generate asymmetries are create problems they really do and so trying to really cultivate symmetry in terms of um a lot of unilateral movements for weight training for instance so like unilateral leg movements or needle arm movements they bring about balance because we just we develop these asymmetries the same way we become righthanded and lefthanded where most of us aren't ambidextrous the phone again is terrible we're all starting to look like a foldedover accordion or a semimelted candle right included if i'm not conscious of it it is very clear and the yogis will will attest to this but for i don't do a lot of yoga admittedly that we are in internal rotation too much so a simple test people can do is if they just relax and they push pulling it out they're standing relaxed and they put out their thumbs if your thumbs are pointed in chances are your shoulder is internally rotated right and that some strengthening of the upper back muscles and and rear neck muscles should be done so that we're not in external rotation like the fonzie thing half the people listening to this won't know who fonzie is but like the like thumbs pointing out in both directions but that doing movements of that sort can then allow us to be neutral right shoulder neutral again so you know i've got a friend any texts i'm if you're if you're listening to this not watching a video he texts with his phone up near his face even on the street which is hilarious but his posture is amazing great posture is is such a a boon to life and um so these little things like internal whether or not we're overly internally rotated trying to be a little bit more externally rotated the other thing is with respect to exercise that has been fun for me to learn about is you know not everybody including myself has time or interest in doing a lot of different kinds of like animal movement i mean i'm a huge fan of mobility i mean that stuff is beautiful like the stuff like edo portals movement culture stuff if people haven't everyone knows who he is presumably but if you don't check out his his instagram he's a he's just been doing this for so long but just incredible suppleness of movement and balance and sure strength and all that but huge range of movement um socalled movement culture is the phrase that he coined but one of the things that's been fun to incorporate is um you know we can do what are called open and closed chain movements closed chain movement would be where like our hands and feet are in contact with the ground so i think down dog is closed chain right think jumping that's open chain right shooting a free throw is open chain you're actually pushing through the nervous system actually it there's a interesting literature on this the scientific literature that closed chain movement tends to build and it's to sound very eastern philosophy but very build energy in the system we tend to come away from it feeling kind of invigorated and x and and um charged and that's because of the way that we have these chains of what are called ganglia neurons along the spinal cord and when we engage in movement that's closed chain where we're in contact with things at both sides the way they fire is kind of in sequence and when we come away from that movement or those types of movements we tend to feel kind of like like energized kind of like jacked up you know and like we have energy whereas jumping movements or throwing movements like if you were to physically throw a medicine ball or you were to um some people can do this don't hurt yourself folks but like you do a chin up but you actually blast through the chin up and let go of the bar for a second those are incredibly taxing but they are very good for dumping excess energy so a lot of people are stressed and then they're going to work out but they're coming out of the workouts with more energy neural energy than they went in and when i say neural energy just so in case there's some neuroscientists out there i don't want you to think i've you know completely lost my mind what i'm talking about is what you're creating is a potential for the nerve cells to fire like a readiness to fire so things like martial arts are they cultivate these practices um both open chain and closed chain kind of intuitively um so and there's a practice a lot of like exhale emphasize breathing on ballistic movements like the like like that's actually expelling energy which is a wonderful thing if you tend to carry too much stress whereas going and just lifting weights close chain movements barbell curls bench presses and thing you're actually creating more tension in the neural readiness in the system so it makes sense absolutely so this is kind of a i rather than get too scientific about this it would take hours what i think was kind of fun for people perhaps to explore is the extent to which different kinds of movements like with continuous tension will kind of create energy so you can come out of those workouts feeling really focused and like energized whereas if you're somebody who tends to just feel like you're carrying tons of tension inside you want to dump energy then throwing things ballistic movements like where you're just literally like dumping all your energy these socalled open chain movements if you can handle it like jumping and ballistic stuff those can be very beneficial and all these have roots in the way that motor neurons of the nervous system work um and again it's kind of fun to just look to animals and just see they a lot of them they look different because they do different types of movements right a kangaroo doesn't look like a tiger for a reason it's because of you think it's because of its body but its body is a reflection of the way the nervous system works not the other way around in addition to this through line where we were started off talking about movement being able to focus the mind you also have been very open that you were recommended to go see a therapist when you were really young and what did you feel that you got out of therapy in addition to this fitness training and the working out that you were doing what was the real sort of distinction that came from you for you at an early age that maybe wasn't a way that you saw either yourself or or the world yeah well and to to be honest you know you earlier you asked you know who's at the at my committee you know so i believe it or not somehow i figured out a way to make this work uh even in tough financial times um and i know not everyone can do that but i've been one way or another i figure so i've been seeing that same therapist for gosh i think it's now been 35 years incredible we have a very close relationship obviously i think it's a healthily bound boundaried relationship um uh actually until i learned oliver sacks who passed away the neurologist man who mistook a white for a hat i have very few heroes in life oliver sachs is is absolutely one of them incredible if you haven't seen the movie uh about the documentary movie about him it's incredible about the field of neurology um he had a therapist i think for 42 years so um and then i felt kind of vindicated because what did i learn from therapy well as a young person i didn't have a choice but to go i had to go if i want to be admitted back in school and stay in school but what i learned pretty quickly was that therapy has multiple levels of support one is somebody who's just going to hear you a lot of people just don't have the opportunity to share what's going on with themselves a lot of people sometimes they may not even know what they think because they haven't said it out loud yeah most of us barely can understand what we're thinking and feeling much less what anyone else is feeling so the next time you think that you understand what someone is thinking and feeling remember most of us don't even understand what we are thinking and feeling but i was look i got lucky he's somebody who's extremely smart and encouraged me to take on physical practices and use those as a portal not just you know lie on the couch and and talk about problems in fact these days we don't even really talk about problems per se the way therapy works that there are multiple aspects to this um but one is you're trying to create a place where you can explore your own mind that's really what good therapy is about it might start with a problem or a conflict but it it's really about being able to explore your own mind and you're constantly asking the question what's driving this behavior or this pattern of thought why am i anxious and the immediate answer is never the answer you know if you think oh i'm anxious because i've got too much work or i've got these things you know sure that's true but but what you're really starting to do is peel back the layers and what you're trying to do is create through the relationship with the therapist you're trying to create a what a process a reflective process the goal of the therapist is to make themselves obsolete that's very clear i've asked this numerous times throughout the years like when are we done you know and and we're done when we know we're done because you you i was told because you internalize a reflective process an ability to see a problem or see a circumstance and take a stance of where am i in this situation where are they and to start parsing out the pieces and it sounds very abstract but and some people might just think like this is terrible when i'm feel stressed i go for a run and i i agree i think a an exploration of thinking of the mind is not for everybody i do think that somatic therapies are now becoming more more popular because many people just think like why would i want to talk about a problem it just makes the problem worse it heightens my focus on the problem i absolutely agree i absolutely agree i just personally have found great depth of experience in realizing how crazy my mind is and how it will come up with these theories about why i feel a certain way and how through a reflective process i can now not certainly not in the past but now i can sort of get distance from things very quickly and i think that can only come about through really being able to sit with your thinking sit with your feelings i'm sure over the years there have been events in my life that have you know where it was like crisis management for sure it's like how are we going to manage this personal crisis but i think therapy is is a if the relationship is right i think it can be a beautiful experience and it it can change the way that you view the mind and it for me therapy nowadays it's not so much about me getting anything out of it it's just making sure that i can show up as as well as i can to the other things and people in my life but um and for people that can't aff fortunately therapies become more accepted and more um hopefully more affordable but for people that can't afford therapy there is a version of this that's gonna sound um ridiculously simple but being able to journal in full honesty with oneself is very powerful journaling is i would say and writing is the way that human beings have worked out a lot of their internal conflicts and discovered incredible depth of of meaning and excitement and creativity over the you know for centuries thousands of years so if people can't get access to a therapist i would encourage them to journal with the full understanding that no one is going to read those journals a lot of people start third personing they start thinking they're writing their life book or their memoir um really journaling in full honesty is powerful some people look at this as a data dump like just a way to kind of get all the mess out early in the day that's powerful as is sitting down and deciding to write in full honesty about something that's extremely challenging or that one is extremely ashamed of or afraid that people will ever find out or these kinds of things because there's something about the way if the mind sees truth like it sees it's internal externalized it immediately looks crazy and in that recognition that so much of what goes on in our heads is crazy there's this weird thing i don't really understand it where beauty like other amazing things crop up as surprises let me give a different example nowadays the words gas lighting comes up a lot people like your gas lighting your gas lighting i'm very averse to people using clinical terms in the context of you know you know online psychology it just doesn't seem to you know it doesn't work for me but the the reality is that most people when they feel something they don't want to feel they use what's called evacuative projection they try and project it out they try and evacuate the feeling this is something so learning to just be able to sit with that and and journaling is one way to do that it it overcomes this need to evacuate anger frustration etc so the the mind's natural reflex is when it doesn't feel something it likes to look for something external to solve the problem or to evacuate the problem right and you've talked about how that can create like even dopamine that's inside of the brain yeah some people are just projecting to projecting yeah projection is a good one and the simplest example of projection is physical aggression i'm angry with you i come over and hit you i've evacuated the feeling right and it's it's an example unless it's in the context of like sanctioned martial arts where it's consensual or something like that it is always an example of weakness always well unless it's warfare or something like that where there's a purpose right you know the military or whatever it is but where there's a contract of people in battle so the so we started off talking about sort of like the therapy model but the but journaling and and learning to deliberately evacuate thoughts and feelings onto paper there's something about the way that the the mind recognizes its own self because you're basically taking your mind and you're putting it to paper when you read and hear those words when you see that happening it has this amazing ability to untangle what seems like a mess and so and i i feel like it's important that people understand that they there doesn't need to be another person there although if it's the right person that can be a real accelerator to the whole process right if you can afford it amazing and there's a lot of really great you know more accessible options that are there but even journaling just finding some outlet to get a sense of where is my mind andrew this has been great i feel like a great part too we could easily be going i feel like we just got started we had a nice little chit chat before we were recording i feel like we could keep on going here but i know you got a couple other podcasts coming up and i want to be respectful of your time and i want to say thank you for coming back on the podcast and doing i think the origin story especially as your profile starts to become a little bit bigger it's nice for people to hear because you are uh you have all the accolades academically and with the research and other stuff and i think it's very hopeful especially for young people to hear wow he wasn't good in school he wasn't you know had challenges and you know these were the things he struggled with it just makes us more of a human to the people that might look up to us and i know a lot of people look up to you so i appreciate you just opening up a little bit more about your story and continuing down the path pathway of providing actionable free tools that people could uh use so i just wanted to say thank you so much for coming back on the podcast and i appreciate you brother oh well thanks for having me and thanks for opening up the conversation to those things it's not things i readily share but i'm always happy too if people are curious and thanks for doing what you do uh just so people have it since the last time that you came on you launched a podcast it's doing fantastic it's i always see it in the top 10 up there and can we give it a little shout out and where people can continue to find you through that podcast as well as the social media channels sure yeah so the podcast is huberman lab for lack of a better name hubert lab podcast and that's on all the standard platforms you can find on you know we do a youtube version of it and apple spotify etc and then i have an instagram where uh i teach neuroscience and neuroscience related themes and that's also huberman lab and sometimes those are the little short tidbits you know 15 seconds sometimes they're minute long sometimes they're five minutes long and they're designed to be accessible to anybody so you don't need any scientific background it's really just focus on neuroscience neuroscience related themes and tools things that people can use in various contexts physical mental et cetera and a lot of good animal videos too and some animal videos and my bulldog costello makes the occasional cameo yeah this good dog well thank you again brother really appreciate you coming back thank you hey youtube if you liked this interview you're going to love this one all on the topic of hacking your circadian biology for better sleep losing weight and better focus if you ever have the experience of being very very busy and then you stop and you finally rest and then you get sick that's because when your nervous system is activated and is in", "the jurogan experience we are going to invent forms of weapons using the artificial intelligence way before we invent something that is capable of the type of intelligence you're talking about i think you're right and the opportunities and the opportunities to destroy ourselves are going to be so multiple because the world is getting so much more complicated all the time yeah right the number of things that can go wrong is much bigger than in the past right 5 000 years ago there was no technology that could have destroyed the planet now there is right right and that is going to continue the our ability to destroy the planet is only going to get greater it's going to take a smaller mistake to destroy the planet as technology gets more sophisticated so you feel it's just human nature that if we have control of artificial intelligence the first thing it's going to do is devise weapons of no no no we are going to devise the weapons using artificial intelligence before there is any overarching artificial intelligence that could take care of us do you see what i'm saying so you're saying the kind of artificial intelligence that's already available not like general artificial intelligence which is what they think of as like a sentient being yeah yeah yeah i mean like stuff that we can do to like youtube or whatever i don't think we disagree so you're saying that this artificial intelligence that's in place right now that they already use for a lot of things yes is going to be used and make weapons it's going to be overwhelming we're going to use them and we're going to use them on each other we're going to blow each other up yes and if we don't artificial general intelligence is what i'm talking about oh if we don't destroy ourselves i'm just you're right we've dropped bomb i mean whenever talks about anybody talks about anything that anyone's done anywhere in the world when they talk about horrific things i always say dude hiroshima and nagasaki that is insane yeah that was a completely untargeted city in the sense that like there's not like there's an army there and they're shooting at us no they just nuked cities the the kind of death and destruction that must have happened on those days to be a person who's an innocent person living on this regime in this city and know that the consequences for something that you've done nothing to all you've done is live your life all you've done is work in a market all you've done is do whatever you've been a farmer and then your entire world is obliterated instantaneously by an atom bomb for the first time in human history and it's happening in your  city yeah well you know what in terms of the the bombings hiroshima and nagasaki weren't really that big a deal in comparison to the fire bombing in contempt comparison to the fire bomb is in comparison to what the germans were doing in the soviet union i understand but there's a thing about the instantaneous nature of those bombs that was uniquely terrifying which is why we haven't used them yes agreed do you have a fear that putin would use one a nuclear weapon yes uh so when i was on question time uh that program of francis do they ask me this question and they said if pushed would he use them now my understanding of the word pushed is if he feels that his life is in danger that's what i mean by post right i think in that situation he would he would use them however that does not mean that they would end up being used he may press the button but the signal might not get to the destination do you see what i'm saying yes there is a team of it's not just a button that releases nuclear weapons there's a bunch of people in between right right and if some of those people think that they have a chance of survival that this is a personal thing against the leader what's their what is their rational what is their rationale for pressing that button down the line how terrifying is this because the answer is a few people but the answer is death right if you're in that situation you your family your kids is going to burn to ashes or die in a radioactive wasteland yes so why would you push that button if you felt there was any chance of survival at all that is one of the biggest  sources of anxiety for people is the idea that we're living in this conflict that we have zero control over that might lead to a global thermonuclear war at any moment in time the wrong buttons might get pressed and the wrong people might get mad at the wrong military decisions might get made and someone just tries to  do something wild we didn't really think that that was a possibility until this ukrainian invasion yeah i think the ukraine invasion opened up a lot of people's eyes because there's so many people from ukraine that have relatives in russia and vice versa it's it's not like you're you you might be at war with your own people like people that you are literally related to yeah that's what's crazy i have family on both sides it's wild yeah the idea is wild and the idea that the the country has such extraordinary control over the narrative of what the people know about and hear about it well 80 of russians get their news from tv and the the message is very consistent and very clear we're about to be attacked nato is about to destroy us uh ukraine's full of nazis and all of this stuff uh completely baseless but that if you feed people that line long enough that's what they're going to believe how do you think this plays out uh i think anyone who attempts to predict this is bullshitting man no you can't predict things like this right now the situation is russia is inching forward both sides are losing a lot uh i think what the russian strategy is to to wait until winter that's what i'm being told to hold out until winter and by winter they think they can persuade the germans to essentially sabotage the western efforts to stop them i think that's their plan how that goes how do we know we can't predict that and in the meantime it also depends on what's happening on the ground right it depends on what russia is going to do it depends on what the western powers do in terms of providing weapons and ammunition and all of that so we've got no idea at all it's so wild and when you hear the government bragging about how much money they're sending over to ukraine to help fight the russians it's like maybe shut the  up for all time remember that one you might want to keep under your hat uh yeah oh you mean in terms of talking about it publicly i mean i'm joking but i'm saying like the the idea that we're we're essentially paying for this war so are we at war or like well at what point in time do you become at war with russia you're not paying for this war you're supporting a country that's defending itself i agree but that's i'm not saying they shouldn't do it what i'm saying i'm not saying they should i'm just i'm not saying i don't have an opinion about it for american taxpayers to decide that right it's not american soldiers but it is american money right so you're funding the war and again i'm not saying i'm against this yeah but i'm saying at what point would someone who knows we're funding that consider us at war with them they already considered us at war with them but i mean enough that an attack would be warranted like that someone would do something if the united states is so vulnerable i mean if someone just attacked our power grids there's a lot of vulnerability in the united states right yeah if they just did that and shut the power down for six months i mean how how effective would we be at almost anything like the whole world is vulnerable at this point in time with nuclear weapons but but we're we're all particularly vulnerable and if there's some sort of an engagement going on like that where we're funding and maybe people believe we should maybe we should i don't know but this is what they're doing is they're funding this war they're helping ukraine fund this war right at least and i'm not saying this is a blow back from not even concerned i'm just saying that what would not just pull back from russia blow back from any country where we would do this at how much money do you put in before they go oh you're at war with us i see what you're saying yeah i mean if you think about all the different times we've done this yeah all throughout history and to aid armies and and fund them and give them weapons at what point in time would someone who opposes those people feel like we're at war with them yeah i see what you're saying so in russia the narrative is that we've been at war with the west this entire time the entire time yeah well this is a defensive action because of nato because we are quite this is the russian version you understand i'm not saying i believe this i'm saying that the the argument not the perception of the russian people the argument that is being made is that we are uh you know it's siege mentality right right and so that's what people there think so from their perspective they already feel that we're a war and have done from the beginning now if you're talking about kinetic war right then i think if the only way that becomes an issue is if the united states gets directly or nato gets directly militarily involved it's like you start shooting down russian planes or shooting russian tanks then then then then of cour well but apart from that i don't see it because you talk about vulnerability america is the least vulnerable country in the world you're the world superpower but even the world i'm not saying you're not vulnerable oh of course yeah i know i understand what you're saying yeah i think um what's terrifying to all of us is that we didn't expect this and we don't know where it's going yeah you know and that it's happening it's it's it's happening to this place that used to historically be connected as the soviet union yeah it's it's fascinating to me but here's the thing if people are terrified yeah people are terrified in the uk because we've bought into this idea that the west has eliminated war you know with a few pockets of things going on but we're safe and we don't have to concern ourselves with that about being having another country you know being aggressive and invading and whatever else so we've bought into that and we felt really safe so safe that we've eliminated it from our minds and this has been an incredibly sharp wakeup call this has been a slap to the face around the west and it's what it's saying is you ain't as safe as you think you are and and the world never in the world doesn't change there will always be war have you ever read anything by thomas sol yes have you read a conflict of visions no he talks about most of what i've seen in seoul just watched him speak yeah brilliant brilliant um he talks about two visions of the world right the constrained what he calls the constrained vision and the unconstrained vision and the constrained vision says that human beings are flawed human beings have certain predispositions human beings aren't rational human beings behave the way they behave and the best way to understand how they are likely to behave in the future is to look at how they behave now and how they've always behaved right right and the unconstrained vision is essentially progressivism it's the belief that this can be changed fundamentally right is the belief that if you um if you do enough social engineering you're going to get to a position where people are going to stop being the way that they are and we're going to build new people a new man uh this is what people said in the soviet union homoseveticus right a new type of human being can be created and we view the world now through that vision through the progressive vision the idea that there would never be war the idea that people would never want to attack us the idea that you know when i went to university to study politics the the thing that was doing the rounds at the time was they called it the golden arches theory of international conflict which was that no two countries with mcdonald's had ever gone to war right it's hilarious yeah and the idea was everyone's too fat no the idea was they're corporately involved and they would prevent this there's so much trade going on yeah that it just doesn't make sense for countries to attack each other right right because and that is a belief that human beings are rational right you believe that people will always act in their own selfinterest as they understand them right but they don't people act because they want status people act because they want power people act because they're scared people act for all sorts of irrational reasons that don't necessarily correspond to the reality and i think we also have to take into consideration that when you're talking about russia when you're talking about the population they're not as exposed to information to the free flow of information as we are in america they there's a lot of people that might have these notions in their head based on what they've seen on television they might buy it hook line and sinker yeah and there might be good people they're just duped well most people in russia are good most people in every country in

the hell are you doing i'm like oh did 15 years well it's episode 666 and i thought in honor of the greatest episode ever i would dress off this is how you really used to go out yeah um i i haven't done this makeup since i was 19 years old it took me an hour yeah and i have to say you know the goth struggle is real it's not easy doing this kind of makeup and i really feel like we should address those issues um and also can i just tell you that the sad part is that i had all this  in my closet yeah we traveled with this because we're not living in austin right now no and with the exception of like one item i had to purchase this is all in my um my repertoire and this is like this is legit how you would go out yeah yeah well this is like a club attire and then if i was like uh yeah if i go out to dinner with my parents or some i do this too piss them off yeah to piss them off yeah this is the susie sue look i i don't know if you know this but there's different types of goth now there's like neo goth um cybergoth i go i'm known as a traditional goth this is my vibe i'm trad goth yeah i do like classic susie vibes there i am wow i believe this is the highest form of goth culture i don't like the new stuff personally anyway i'm super pumped to look like this am i i want to look this way every day i just love it that makes one of us yeah what do you how do you feel about your goth wife what the  you don't like it no really i mean it's fun for a party well because here's the deal man is that goth chicks like we would land preppy guys all the time because they secretly want to bang you oh like it's well yeah because you're alive you know like guys just want to bang women  that's that's our motivation i thought it was special hey you see that chick with kayak gear i want a banger because she's walking around yeah you know what's funny i used to get hung by black guys a lot really dress like this yeah black guys love goth checks how come they're just like i don't know dude but i'll be rocking this gear and like first of all i grew up around this neighborhood and it's this is so reminiscent of my life because this is the middle of summer and i would go full goth like this like to the um the mall or whatever and yeah black dudes just love this look real talk they come yeah talk to me all the time i think they thought i was freaky right it's like this chick's gonna put out like goth chicks do crazy stuff but right i don't know i wonder if most goth chicks did do freaky  well so there's different types of god chicks too there are some very  ones here let me join you and they yeah and they wear um like latex pants which aren't very porous 666 i love this what you're saying is goth chicks have stinky  i'm hypothesizing so yeah because uh latex is not porous like i said and and then the guys would wear it too and i imagine those nuts were pretty stinky too back in the day yeah yeah especially during the industrial phase like there's industrial music that's what i used to like too and those guys would wear like all the bondage gear and it's it's got to be stinky when you're dancing for sure well you mean you wouldn't would you want to bang me if we like we're in high school right yeah you're preppy tom right i'm me you want to be attracted to this as a teenager um you know a little bit i think maybe a little bit because but it's kind of like how it's different it's like oh you know what's up with that chick and then someone's like oh sh she's from  croatia you're like oh okay because like you know different it's like it's different she looks different it's different different yeah yeah yeah it feels right it's like when i was putting this on i mean it's really your heart and soul i know that yeah yeah it just feels good oh i think i could and also let's let's be honest yeah do you love halloween i love halloween you do oh it's my favorite yeah that's my favorite holiday i know can't i can't help myself tom i think i may have to keep this for a while you okay with that it just went out do parliaments go out a lot nope i think you just got uh we used to smoke cloves where's my clothes hate clothes yeah everybody does did i just like the filter no jesus anyway do you want to know what my goth names were sure okay ready yeah there's a few names i would go by when i look like this um widow that one was kind of hard to say in a nightclub widow and then i go by pandora that's this is before the music service different yeah or crimson crimson i like cream that's kind of cool yeah because it's like christina crimson crimson's dina and i like um spider sometimes i go by spider oh  i think i'm on fire um  this is not as enjoyable as i remember kind of hurts when you inhale this i feel like we should start doing this more yeah middle age yeah let's do syringes next time you know what's funny is that goth people do a lot of we did a lot of crystal meth back in the day which is kind of ironic because you think this look is a bummer but we would get super jacked and like high and have the best time oh so you did do crystal meth no i say we is in the collective group i would watch other people do crystal meth and then we'd dance all night and it was like we're kind of fun you know sure yeah that's a good time yeah i hear you anyway i'm back okay yes i'm a piece of  yes i'm so happy to be back in the studio i love the studio i this is the very first studio we created look a lot of people don't maybe think about it but podcasting and this whole world like we had to kind of punk rock it and diy it and and invited as we went along and this studio really represents all the hard work and the ingenuity of tom segura sometimes nadav when he could spell things correctly any zolo all the all these people everybody yeah team effort it's pretty rad isn't it and the um multiple liars that sound proofed it yeah that'll be another 20 grand and you're like wait what    piece of  piece of  but it feels good to be back here and we've been in la now for a few weeks yeah and um i've been eating a lot of sushi a lot of korean foods yeah lots of flavors out here so many  flaves bro and like just going to my old haunts and um i've been enjoying it i've really been enjoying it it's been fun yeah i went to an alpaca farm with our kids and montecito have you been so it's so fancy it's where oprah lives uh i wish you were born that there  me too dude they wouldn't let me in no they'd been like there's a actually you need to show your papers up here so then i went to an alpaca farm yeah and this  karen was giving us directions on like you approached the alpacas and then you don't touch her and i totally tuned it out i was like shut up  you know yeah and i went in and i started to pet the alpaca on its back and it  kicked me twice so hard sounds like you should have listened to her i should put yeah and the kids were watching me and i was like see mom didn't listen to the directions so that's how i got kicked like a dummy but it's weird that they have alpaca farms because they don't like being touched yeah and then you went and touched one yeah or like it was an excursion where you can touch alpacas and like they don't enjoy it they're running from us they're kicking us they're spinning on you i have a buzz right now me too yeah from smoking the cigs yeah it makes me want to smoke other stuff yeah yeah let's get faded bro yeah you got a blunt 666 let's go but there's one right around the corner i can go make a run you wanna do i don't know i'll just pass out on the show you can do whatever you want yeah the spookiest episode ever spooky and we got some spooky spooky surprises coming oh yeah here let's uh let's open the clip real quick here it's been a long time right it's been

rest of this video because they pull their tits out his own magic ways you know he does he's so charming in so many regards he's  fantastic yeah he's alive he's alive and in our hearts and you're hot i might i think he might be out there i think he might be in wuhan he started this thing from the source yeah uncovering the conspiracy oh my god speaking of wuhan so i'm laying in our bed it's like 11 o'clock at night and i hear well you know if the chinese want us to lack them maybe they could stop giving us covet okay and then this other guy chimes in with like you telling me buddy and i was like what is the show like where is this coming from yeah so i get up i i trace the noise and it's in our closet and it turns out it's our kids walkietalkie yes and it's picking up trucker talk yeah yeah it's picking up rfi interference i don't know but that's what dave dave oak and my uh tour manager is a um an expert in this stuff and i told him he's like yeah that's rfi interference so uh radio frequency interference so um yeah and then yesterday that walkietalkie was out and it was like and a good morning to everybody how you guys doing out there really yeah we could you imagine your threeyearold playing with that and he's like mom the chinese are giving us coven they're like where did you hear that from yep my walkietalkie yeah i mean now so my dad used to listen to a shortwave radio um was your israeli dad into that uh he did have a lot of car gadgets yeah i like to pick up the police radar detectors yeah and speed jammers yeah those kinds of things he's just like so that whenever you like he had the the radar detector so that as soon as that went beeping was like oh you can't get caught with this so he'd immediately unplug everything until he passed a cop and he's like cool now we can plug everything back yeah so did my dad the the lapd like scanner he would have that he would have the speed radar and then the radio that could pick up like programming all over the world and he would lay he would like sit in his room in the dark drinking listening to like hungarian spooky ass radio it was terrifying jesus christ but he they love that  i don't know some guys love listening to radio but now i'm into it yeah now i'm listening for my truckers every night he's like what are they talking about what's going on talking about wuhan that  was so funny dude yeah like the fact that i got to hear that at that specific chinese wanted us to like them maybe they could stop giving us covet over and over oh no well yeah like they're doing it jesus christ i have a point okay that trucker talk i'm sure it gets a little racist from down time to time yeah and this was california trekker talk so i was surprised you know yeah i think it's everywhere yeah i know they drive from out of state too you know it's so funny because the the mask stuff still happens here you're like are we still doing that oh yeah because in texas they were like covered never happened there's no covid yeah you   well um you know so much to talk about this episode uh one of the things i'm real happy to bring back um for this episode is one of my alltime favorite plays and this is an actual new clip for us but one of our favorite celebrities to ever be on the show oh wow welcome to revelation unraveled yes i'm your host william tapley also known as the third eagle of the apocalypse and the coprophet of the end times yep on this program i want to talk about contraception and how using that will prevent you from being raptured last week the pope made news headlines by saying that you cannot prevent aids through the use of condoms and of course he was correct the only true way of preventing aids or any other sexually transmitted diseases is through a monogamous relationship between our husbands yeah that's a way to prevent aids when monogamous monogamous yeah wait also by the way i love that he stops a fullsize oh yeah that's his lapel mic yeah you like that like you can go on amazon do you think he's gonna do that i like it's ten dollars stuffed a fullsize mic into his jacket sounds good though it does sound good it does yeah oh where monogamous if uh if you don't remember him this is just a brief commentary on a new flag created for the obama campaign now up here on the left we have the official logo i love the obama campaign and that's a big o which of course stands for him and below that there are several stripes which indicate the homosexual movement i think he's one of my top favorites yeah and below obama's logo we have two stripes and three stripes which look much more like streaks of blood now some people don't like this kind of perversion of the american flag because it is very satanic oh i didn't see satanic but he does 666 all right right he did this for this episode and of course as my regular subscribers know the two stripes over three represent the antichrist because two over three is the number 066 wait a minute two over three hold on twothirds is no i'm not a math major but is anyone good at math here is this accurate no yeah it is yeah 066 repetitive yeah that's correct wow wow we're just getting to the bottom of

the ground and god was so displeased with this that he killed onan well how do we know he spilled his head on the ground and not on her stomach that's where most of us spill seed and that's not the planned parenthood method well i think he's trying to you know take a jab when he can she's pointed out that they're i feel like he's a a third cast member for he's down on the call sheet on the bible do you remember onan he is the second eagle of the apocalypse he's the third eagle he is the third eagle he said also known as like like you guys know me i'm the third eagle of the apocalypse oh i know a lot of people think well the pope should not make the rules true they like to say if you don't play the game you don't get to make the rules right but of course this is another lie from satan can you tell me any game in which the player makes the rules oh wow thank you mantle make the rules for baseball no did michael jordan make the rules for basketball no of course not no good logic the person who makes the rules for any game is the inventor of the game and so i ask you who invented the game of sex the pope so he's saying so by definition he's saying the pope invented the rules because he'll make the rules and therefore the pope has to invent the pope is relaying the rules from god yeah because he's a direct channel yes he is god speaks to the pope regularly i think on a phone really yeah there's a phone like a vatican yeah yeah hello god it's me the pope yeah that's amazing it's a white phone it's a white phone yeah people think it's red but that's actually like the president has a red phone right pope phone's white i wish they that we could go to vatican city and use that phone do you think we could purchase like a vip package and i don't think so i think you got to be invited by the pope he has to you know see photos of your children and then he lets you into his room it's like an airbnb yeah yeah you only do that now they're like you have to see a photo of you of you oh oh you get an airbnb and then they're like you're black we actually were booked we're booked exactly i was like is this proof that i'm white or something we were gonna run it to you but then we just remembered that it was already rented out yeah i swear to god it felt racist to me there's so many accounts of black people being like my airbnb canceled before like we showed up and they're like oh we forgot we forgot that it's not available i don't like in my oppression to that okay okay i'm more like you know just goth writes like nobody gives goth writes yeah like i should be able to work at night time because i'm nocturnal yeah but like society wants me to have a day job oh it's true yeah but there should be more there's not enough there's not a man's trying to hold me down that's true god invented the game of sex and therefore he gets to make the rules huh and if you don't live by those rules you will pay the consequences in this life you will get sexually transmitted diseases and in the next life you will suffer for all eternity oh  he's someone's dad too right he's definitely got kids that's the most terrifying dad you could have because for sure you don't you don't know how to say anything back for like a decade or more you know you're just like my dad's the third eagle it's  yeah like i was so scary i would rather have a dad that is just absent than like third apocalypse dad who just spits nonsense nonsense and you're like yeah that's cool but but you grew up listening to this so you think this is real too like you don't know one better until other people are like hey you know that this stuff's crazy right oh yes talking to voices but it would take you a while yeah you go to school and say this  to other kids airport satanic did you guys know that yeah your friends are like well like in kindergarten stuff they're like that is hilarious you know this kid thinks the denver airport is satanic and then yeah probably i don't know around fourth grade is when they would start being like i think your dad's real  up man great you're like i'm out of here oh my god i'm living with you fools anymore no no um so one thing we should like maybe uh point something out to people who don't know is i'm sure the i mean many of you would agree the alltime greatest find ever in the history of 666 episodes of this podcast is one robert paul champagne check it out um you guys know him of course my bills and tried out so we love him we've celebrated him for years in this studio was the day that we actually we found footage of him outside of the original video i believe and then i believe episode 420 was that the one where we actually spoke to him i think that was the first time that we ever watched a video oh played him okay and then you know like more than a year later 200 episodes we've been talking about that yeah we've been we we actually got a contact and we spoke to him and it was the best day it was epic it was in this studio it was so insane so good and ever since then you know i mean we've had specials where we you know we sent a crew i mean uh uh josh potter went out there for us dr drew has visited rpc rpc has been on ymh lives yep it's been you know and it's a it's a gift that never stopped giving and we're just you know we love the guy well one thing i started to notice and maybe you did too a little while ago is that rpc has been leaving increasingly um upset inflammatory type messages in comments on virtually everything we post um and he's been taking a a lot of extra shots at me at me personally um so we we flagged some of them we pulled them so that we could share them with you um so here we go this is something i think i posted he wrote have to worship the big ham never wrote that book right he's referring to my book which is a new york times bestseller yes and you know i was like i remember i saw one of these and you're like wait who's that and you're like huh okay and then he's claiming that you never wrote the book then he posted this himself he wrote i was famous before ymh and i'm not jealous of tom segura's socalled nasty fame and now he believes he is written never wrote that book his staff done it for him please i'm getting better and better and more happier and creative and can do comedy and music and act don't need a writer uncle shine rusty is a big joke and thinks he is so proud and famous that people can't stand his foul mouth or crummy appearance sorry i'm getting back into life and will be so tom stop copying style and words and dressing style get your own style rpc lucifer's lair the hot one always right wow it sounds like he's going after a shine too yeah well he does and he has mocked unshine we played a clip of him mocking unshine a little while ago he did like an impression of him that was it was pretty nasty yes um but the p he he's continued you know he writes these comments here tom is losing it and to label people is so old these days tom never broke me down oh wow tom we don't label people thank you tom we don't label people thank you tom we so he's repeating that message there um why is tom segura telling bert to dress like a grown man tom you dress like an overage team look in the mirror oh boy he's definitely he's doing something he's that picture of him is shirtless too by the way yes he's telling you how to he's dressing like right okay okay he's increasingly getting more and more upset yeah and and it's you know we've seen these everywhere now look in the mirror tom are repeating that stop giving advice he wrote a nasty one to you here yes he did i was surprised now he's coming after me this is so funny though so this is in reference to my my special mom jeans she looks like miss piggy and muppet he's not wrong would you google miss piggy in muppet land this made me lol he that was really funny i thought i actually do and i completely forgot that she dressed like that it's the blonde hair and the pink yeah yeah okay super funny but anyway so yeah there she is oh yeah it does look like so sticky i mean the thing is is that you know i mean people could propose different theories it's is it maybe that we haven't paid attention to him in a while yeah can i tell you toddlers when you don't pay enough attention to them will lash out and he's i think he's i think he needs a little tlc a little love a little ymh attention he needs love from us i think he feels a little discarded a big phony phoney and tom is short in his brain i mean these are like every day yeah every day whether it's posted by the ymh account my personal account he says something it's like he wants your attention kind of feels like it i think and you know what's funny is that he always felt more comfortable going after you yeah so this makes sense you're you're his guy and i think he feels neglected and i think you need to give him a little love i think maybe you're right um i think the only way to maybe do that is um you know maybe i give them a call yeah so let's see here jordan is please leave your message for nine one seven hold on let me try and give you the other phone number how do you change the language of that all right um well we just tried calling robert twice he has two phones uh busy i mean i get it he's active he's doing things and uh he gave us two numbers to reach out said he would be down for this call um he talked to nadav and he didn't answer so well you know it is 1pm on the east coast he's probably in meetings and and yeah he's doing something the stock market's going to close here in a couple of hours right that is true so yeah it's probably the end of the day you think that's what it is he's trading he's doing stuff yeah could be could be um he's upset you know what i get it this is only confirmation of our theory that he is he's upset with us he's definitely upset i mean i think he's actually just looking at his phone like no no yeah he like he's stomping he's probably in that meeting yeah people are talking and he looked and everyone's like nah yeah you know what he just kicked me like the alpaca i tried to pet him that is a great yeah he just gave us alpaca great analogy i mean gosh we really wanted to hash this out because i actually you know i don't want robert upset with me of course not he's he's one of the greatest gifts to humanity yeah he's a sweet man he's a loving soul and we want to repair this relationship robert i can't resist i have to hit this one more time just to see hahaha see if he'll can't help yourself tom no god i'm gonna have to dye my hair blonde again it's gonna take forever this is ringing i mean he sees this hello  no no he answered it we heard the tv in the background yeah and then he hung up this is yeah i think you gotta go again we gotta go again maybe it's because you didn't say anything in the first second he thought right right right right right right right i think you're supposed to say hello when you pick up the phone yeah okay here we go  robert please leave your message  try again try the other number the other number yeah i don't think i think the other one's gonna work i think the first one's the one to do it that's the one that he picked up yeah and no one's a voicemail how does it go to spanish i don't know i mean come on dude how could we he's this upset he is honey he's not happy with you and me i miss piggy and he really did i mean i cannot he knows this is us calling yeah at this point well maybe he's maybe he's doing that like you gotta chase me thing yeah he is well you have to send him flowers guys we need to send him like a gift we need to butter him up because please leave your message okay you know what this point is confirmed he is so angry what can we send him to make amends is it flowers uh i think it's any i don't know why don't you you know what why don't you just try calling him okay mma fans as the fighters face off during ufc 277

on stuff out okay very good news very good update um i'm if there's anywhere we can send people if you i think you should get a website for your charity that would help a lot we could drive people to your website that would be very helpful i would tell tell you i put on my i put it on my instagram a lot okay okay i always put it on i always mentioned it i said rpc kit so i put the address i said if they send money uh put it in a danielle marie her name her real name her name like daniel marie you sent it to her yeah you put the money in the envelope then uh i if you put my my address on it and i sent to her and then i go to jennifer and jennifer puts it in the mail for her well that's easy enough so thank you for now i get now i get it um we'll just throw the money in the envelope you give it to darlene she gives it to you then jenny and then everything's bought that's how i was done okay there we go uh robert um it's always nice to hear your voice um like i said we're celebrating episodes 666 we were talking about how you're the most fun person we've ever found doing this podcast and i'm happy to hear that you're not upset with me you were just upset in the moment um and which is why you called me short in my brain and a big phone yeah well i've got the dizzy queens calling me every time and that every and every time i tell me all these crazy stuff i thought i don't want to hear no more people tell me anymore yeah life yeah all right um please stay in touch let us know what you're doing and give us updates on the charity fundraising and you know it's just uh it's good to talk to you robert okay okay uh okay uh and and any and and nadav both say hello and they uh they're asking if they could come by and um i told them it's on the house yep no problem all right you just give us the thumbs up and they're going to be on a plane okay okay no problem thank you robert byebye have a good one byebye whoa you know what we were right he's very busy he's extremely busy charity work he's being cast for so many parts and things could you even keep up with those chess moves of how to donate oh my god i mean there were new people being added to the equation as it man remember when um the queen's above 18 guy wanted to sell shirts steve yeah was that did that air or was that just where he was like yeah he's like go you email me and then you find my paypal and then send me an email after you paypal me let me know what size shirt and then and the address and don't forget you got to tell me the size for and you gotta go to paypal first after you tell me that you want a shirt you don't think there's a better system than this well i think this system is even worse no this makes sense i don't want to do the whole website thing you put the money in an envelope you send it to darlene then she'll give it to me i'll give it to jenny jenny will buy the stuff and then it's a good charity there you go there you go easy peasy lemon squeezy and i don't see any way that this would by any chance results in people losing money and not going to charity what enough i need a break yeah you must be you need a nap too that's exactly yeah well i'm glad he's not mad at us he's it sounds like his beef is with unk shine well but also it sounds like he he mentioned a couple times that people are feeding him misinformation i don't know he's like i'm talking to people saying this and saying like people are gossiping to him about things i don't know it's just hi my theory is is that either he's jealous that ung shine is getting so much attention he really doesn't like him or he's secretly attracted to unk shine he also said any other cigarette you need to smoke yes like black people aren't like that anymore yeah what the hell like that he's like you know they're not like that there was that time we're back i want another cigarette too let's smoke again yeah that was great because i saw any go and he's not into any sexually yeah it's weird that was a direct offering and he was like um yeah i got rejected by rpc i mean that wow that's got to feel something you gotta feel something i feel like  yeah horrible well at least he's into something good it sounds like charity is good for him you know like yeah oh here you go that's a really cool it's a good thing he's into i do wish he'd get that website going wow feels like the old days yeah i feel like a bad girl i'm a bad god girl now whoa chad watch out you know what let's do a little role playing is this how i looked when we met kinda because you always say i was wearing fish not until we met you were and i was smoking like this you were yeah you want to be honest totally true like the truth i thought you were a prostitute it was sunset boulevard stop in front of the club yeah i was like she's working she's trying to get like a john to walk in her out of here i remember i had 40 bucks i was like this is a ton of cash whatever i thought you were hillbilly because you were like i was like what's your name you're like tom you know you say your name all stupid because you just come from the south they just come from this come from south and then i was all i was like where are you from oh you're not from la look you know that was all cool yeah and you're like you're like i'm from florida and i was like ew like i never really knew anybody from florida because you know la is so la all right like you're just from here you're not it's like whatever and i remember judging you a little bit because i was like you really remember that yeah you're like this is a  help i thought you were kind of like a hick yeah because i'm like well he's not from la and i angelino's secretly judge outsiders a little bit we're like i don't know you like you're not really yeah so i was like trying to size you up and i was like do you have like a pickup truck or something like i didn't know i just didn't know back at the you know i was young i hadn't really like i traveled but not yeah you just don't know the rest of the culture you know that's true american i now i'm a texan i i totally i legit thought you were a hooker stop it i did i wasn't dressed like a  i was doing a show how horror could i have been you were sitting down on stairs with fishnet smoking i was like this is a prostitute yeah yeah i did a lot of that in my early life prostitution center no just like sitting on stoops smoking like dark corner like and i kind of knew how to eyeball them because i was working at that restaurant on sunset which was a track and they would come in and buy lemonade so lemonade yeah that's the whole drink i was like oh do you want a lemonade you know why lemonade because we had good lemonade i was like lemonade yeah you know what's so crazy oh my god i feel like i have to  the amount of cigarettes used to make me have to  you guys wouldn't remember that fact but you know cigarettes make you have to  it's making me have to  do you want to go no i'm not gonna  here are you crazy what do you mean you said you have to  i've only  at ymh studios once when i had diarrhea even annie who's wearing a mask today because we're not sure if it's stomach flu or food poisoning went to  arby's to take a  he wouldn't even  here why i'm trying to help you guys man you don't want that in your bathroom trust me oh right it's a mess it's a mess i went in there i had to go in the employee bathroom because i went to the arby's and there i was like can i use the bathroom he's like i think someone's in there i'm like i don't think you understand man like in about two minutes something is about to explode he was like go ahead yeah well he said he told me the code to the uh to the employee one yeah and then i blew the  up and i feel pretty bad but i mean what are you gonna do yeah what are you gonna do yeah um didn't like a lot come out because you know you hold it in so much but it was so much but it wasn't like i mean this is i don't have food poisoning ever you know i'm saying like this is like the first time in like a decade that i've had food poisoning yeah so it came out like you know that was on a liquid light a week ago yeah where a very large man took a dump and it came through the whole cabinet no god i hate that i actually was looking down and i was like what is that where is that coming from uh and it was the dude and so it kind of like it makes you think about does it i mean it makes sense right a larger human makes a larger  that is more powerful yeah one time i mean i had this in the book i shared a condo this is a really interesting topic well no this is true i shared a condo a comedy condo meaning just like the club owns a space a really shitty one yeah there was two bedroom one bath so you shared the bathroom with the other comic for the weekend i mean not the most desirable thing but you're kind of like you know you're working at these clubs and you're like this is just what it is you know most the time you wouldn't put that much thought into it other than the inconvenience of it but i was working one weekend with a 600 pound guy wow and um he would  and it would come through the walls it would come through the walls what was he eating i may need 600 pounds just everything yeah obviously and the funny thing was you know i remember about this guy we went out to lunch and at lunch he goes have you seen so and so like another comedian i go uh not in a while he goes he's getting big what he's like he's really got to watch his weight i'm like yeah he sure does yeah yeah um which does pose a very interesting philosophical question yeah does a bigger person necessarily make a bigger  i don't know because because hold on you guys are shaking your head no but we have a sixyearold that takes that's a good point monstrous dumps i mean the point where they poke out of the water right meaning that it's it's actually it's not negates that theory because here's a little 45 pound dude taking like adultsized dumps who by the way he has like a minimal appetite i know he doesn't eat that's not a big eater no what are you  out yeah but why why are these two huge guys that i'm talking about  so potent that it's penetrating the walls and filling the cabin of it of a flight yeah really interesting questions what do you think well we know we need to do is we need to ask somebody that's once been super super fat and then lost a bunch of weight and gotten healthy and be like wear your shirts bigger when you were heavier well i can say this as somebody who's been fatter in my life and then less fat is is your shits are more like reckless when you're fatter they're crazier shits and is it because you're just eating kind of haphazardly yeah whatever you have like no standards for what goes into your body right so you're just like you're just eating junk all the time yeah so your shits are always disasters every shit's an emergency you know you know what's interesting though is that that healthier my diet gets the more horrendous my shits are meaning i eat more salads i eat more fiber and like it's just like it's so much brown you know yeah it's not good big or just like foul just like runny and like ugh not to use the bidet longer than i wanted to right nice god yeah yeah the healthier you eat that's the irony like i bet vegans take crazy dumps because my cousin when she went vegan she's like dude i take like brontosaurus size shits she's like because i eat so much yeah everything you eat just comes right out of you i think that's like the benefit of going vegan is that you're just so cleaned out you know could be could be but then my dad always had this theory he would say big dog makes big  small dog makes small  that's also true like a little tiny dog has little like little pellets come out yeah so it's like you got a 150 pound dog yeah yeah it looks like a  man's  yeah so size the roulette the relativity of the size to the dump it makes sense it makes sense you should have been on this plane no thank you oh my god it literally i was looking at the ground i was like something's ah something's happening here it took me a minute to figure it out i'm more up you were flying commercial yeah believe me when it took me a couple days to get over what a nightmare yeah yeah i don't know who takes violent dumps on planes i really try to avoid that at all costs yeah yeah the one time i started over africa i remember we were flying africa i remember but even then i didn't i didn't take like a violent  i just sharted i don't think i've taken a violent  i don't remember okay it's been a while thanks for bringing it up you got it wait do you not do you not do you disagree with this yeah it's like shaking his head like oh no i know better well because i don't think that it's like big people make big shits and i don't think that the good argument is that oh well kids have small shits because it's like i think everyone's kids have adult size shirts but what about my dad's theory that big dog makes big  little dog makes little  it's it's true it's true that those are those are different animals like the dogs also have like eight nipples but that's not us but we're similar look okay what about like tiny chicks tiny chicks don't  as big as nadav like a tiny little petite girl vegan oh god this is such a complicated issue and also i don't take huge shits can we get a gastroenterologist i'm pretty sure it's all relative you don't know but you don't know that you take you don't know that because they're your shits are you looking at other people's shits yeah you've looked at other people all the time who's like at the office before anyone everyone knows the rule he knows everybody's  style i know yeah yeah this isn't just a hobby for me guys he does now i gotta bring something up what's that i'm sorry you said you look at the size of these shits yeah how do you know i have cameras and stuff oh my god oh my god wait do you  at the office in uh texas never no no those are nice stalls i know that's a shame i can't use them it's a real big shame like look it's for y'all it's for y'all i'm a nice guy you know and i'm trying to help you guys out just give it to us one time dude you don't want it one time you don't want it we do you don't we do it will i mean you don't wanna know what time bro i mean i'll just tell you let's think about it because any holds it in for so long but his dumps are catastrophic by the time he lets it happen it's probably devastating i am curious though it's horrible me too can you take a picture please uh no i can't do it what if we'd like do it on a saturday so it has like what the  is the difference it has like a day or two to dissipate like it won't smell terrible on a monday if you do it on a saturday or friday evening even better uh oh man because here's the other thing here's the more important part actually it's not just catastrophic it's  giant like normally so it it's gonna get clogged on standby no i ain't doing nothing i ain't doing nothing i'm trying to help you out man i'm trying to help you help us better a plumber would come in and be like you know uh you can't just  on each other's  in here you gotta flush between them um annie are you sitting down when you  at arby's or are you standing on the are you squatting on the toilet seat neither i don't i'm not even gonna touch my feet to that  i'd just be standing and  wait a minute yeah so you hover over it yeah from the ground yeah from what yes oh you mean from the toilet right no i'm not touching the toilet i don't touch that you stand on the ground you just hover yeah that's how you took a  this morning must have amazing i can't squat that and you're vulnerable you're  yeah i don't want to relax for 30 years no i don't want to relax i want to get the hell out of there and push it out super quick you know what i'm saying yeah yeah i enjoy dumping i mean i think it's one of life's good pleasures taking a dump you know i think most people yeah it's most people it gets like a relaxing thing you know if it's healthy you're kind of like uh it's a break hold on and that was an interesting potty break for everybody i know i wanted to take a dump and then the toilet here is about to flood yeah like which is funny because like i went in there i peed yeah it was fine yeah you peed so who went who went first in the lineup is what i'm wondering because we all peaked well zola was in there but i think he peed too right yeah i thought i was about to get some more intel on the type of shits that he takes because he's the one that i don't really know how he does it right this is an exact conversation is why i don't do this this one right here yeah yeah so it went zolo and then didn't no and then no nadab peed first no i didn't even repeat he didn't pee so zolo and then tom and then me and by the time i went in there i thought to myself i go should i try and relax enough to brown here because that cigarette and i'm drinking espresso should i do it and i try to relax my shrink d a little bit didn't happen and i was like  it i'm done and i flushed and i heard and then you know what i mean i'm like oh this is bad like oh we share a pipeline with our neighbor who one time this was actually very satisfying when i heard this it clogged and the plumbers came and they're like oh it's all this like um like whatever wipes or something in the and they go oh it could be from that side and the plumber was like no it's from your side like the plumber straighten them out the wipes so who was using wipes they were using them over there oh sorry their side not on other side okay yeah yeah that you can't put wipes in the plumbing that's and people have said to me oh but christina have you tried the biodegradable kind and i've been told that even those will destroy you but what do you want to bet that's what this is right now it's gotta be it's them first of all no one's even been here on this side right yeah and the fact that we're both and she was uh when i went next door i was like hey you know uh our bathroom's acting up how's yours doing can you see if you flush he's like well someone just went in right now and it was fine for them something tells me that uh that's the culprit mr wipes mr wipes it's somebody with wipes yeah which i get you know i mean they're amazing they feel much better they can't wait to tell them to cover the bill yeah are you yeah how will you have empirical oh because we haven't been here yeah no one's been here you could be like we haven't even like people have peed here i took two shits here on friday yeah yeah it's not your dumps no wow you took two it was a travel day yeah that'll do it traveled is ruin all your browns um so i got something to show you this guy uh carlos he is the eye exorcism why is it called the eye exorcism do you know yeah the if you remember there's the guy he uploaded to youtube where he just used his eyes to oh to to perform an exercise to perform an exorcism on whoever's watching on youtube all right folks oh yeah go and talk with me right now i'm going to expose your demons okay i'm gonna command them to surface okay okay now pay close attention to what i'm gonna say here you really you really do got to take care of your eyebrows as you get older you know they just get wild wild and and the thing is it looks as though he's done some measures because he plucks in between them yet leaves the length on the rest yeah it's too long i feel like mine grow at such an alarming rate they do you know they really do and i've tried to maintain you and pluck you and keep you yeah i'll only notice because like one will come into my vision you know like i'll move and i'll be like what is that or also i don't look at my face very much so i'll lean in and then i'll be like oh wow there's some real longies here yeah as soon as you do it you feel better you know yeah this is this is unnecessary and also i believe it ages your face a lot more if they're longer you need to trim them yeah you look wild i agree i agree um so anyway he has a new update this guy oh and it's not a performance of an exorcism with his eyes but uh it is a really interesting thought so what i want to say here is this okay okay open mouth french kiss is oral sex okay wow and everyone loses their virginity when they kiss for the first time so please subscribe to this channel i didn't know that until like maybe like a month ago oh a month ago right cheers but i pray and i really get revelation yeah i just learned it right now i just learned it right now so he's saying that a french kiss is technically you losing your virginity virginity yeah virginity is cool come on come on do you tom okay if you really want to have a blessed marriage a blessed family in life do things god's way don't do things hollywood way hollywood think what's the youtube way don't you think cnn way don't do think you know uh uh you know don't you think hollywood's way because it's going to it's going to mess with you do things god's way how about that yeah  social don't do things what action is that is that portuguese you think is he brazilian don't do think hollywood yeah latin something there are principles that will if we apply them we'll be protected but if we break them yeah we're gonna be at the devil's mercy right oh gee so i just had this word for you you don't have to believe the way i do i'm just you know uh trying to help people you know avoid more curses okay if you fornicate before you got married if your marriage is not done you know heaven's way chances are it will not work either what because it's already full of curses and demons and devils right demons and devils we fornicated before marriage that's true it's true and many people do many people do and they're all going to be in hell for eternity and the hollywood i think you know he would really click like really really really quick with um god invented the game of sex and therefore he gets to make the rules and if you don't live by those rules you will pay the consequences in this life you will get sexually transmitted diseases and in the next life you will suffer for all eternity man such an extreme reaction how does god dictate what sex will be god does god have a dick oh yeah of course what kind of what's his dick sitch it's pretty  spectacular god's dick do you think god has like you're like um that's all you got no it's a what do you imagine it to be the greatest of all time and what's that like shape girth well first of all i don't think god is like 61 you know i think he's probably like you know 10 feet tall or something oh my god it's god he's not gonna be like he's gonna how large is god's penis yeah you're right he's 10 feet tall yeah so i think his penis is probably flaccid 16 inches easily yeah and girthy like a forearm you know yeah yeah that's so this is an article about it yeah yeah i think it's pretty enormous oh they uh spectacular and behold thus shall conceive in thy womb and bring forth the son and chuck called him jesus that's the argument that he does have it there but here's the thing about god's penis i think it is so i don't think it is one that a human being could fornicate take well like mary was inseminated by god yeah but they didn't do it the os way right right he did it the god way so maybe he just oh maybe he maybe he came on her stomach like we were saying earlier because god doesn't spill his seat on the floor that's like rule number one so he came on her stomach and then it trickled down in inside god stick move i mean the semen moved in it's quite possible yeah it's quite possible um yeah i don't think like somebody can get to heaven and be like hey can i take that for a ride and god's like sure yeah i think i think i think well first of all i think it would just i think it would rip you in half because if he's 10 feet tall yeah he's like sasquatch yeah that's what i think he's super big yeah i think he's giant i think he looks like you know like a caricature of a person but like a glorious one perfect do you think he has the long hair like the long white hair and white bear like this guy kind of and a blue dick and a blue dick nice dude blue and veiny yeah and just like like scary i think it looks like a weapon you know like uh like a sword or something you know so cool yeah pretty cool guy that's what i dream about i don't know i don't know i know there are principles that will if we apply them we'll be protected but if we break them we're gonna be at the devil's mercy right yeah so i just had this word for you you don't have to believe the way i do i'm just you know uh trying to help people you know avoid more curses okay he's just trying to fornicate before you got married if your marriage is not done you know heaven's way chances are it will not work either now everything else that you're doing out there looking at women's legs if you're a man and then that's only going to make the situation worse if you're watching pornography if you keep you know adultery is a major major sin that will open so many doors for demons to come in and destroy people family marriages and the like for generations to come it's called adultery adultery can can open a door for an infirmative different infirmity demo to come in and put a cancer in somebody why not oh well he has a website oh i like his uh style like this video and subscribe and then now it says visit brothercarloscom yeah deliverance videos telephone prayers and more and more yeah what's more oh the website doesn't work that's strange yeah yeah you know what's funny he mentioned he's like you're looking at women's legs like you know that's what makes his deck hard because he threw out women's legs also he's from brazil so he's been seeing legs for a while yeah and delicious and he's and he's like that the culture is a super sexual culture it is why that's so funny they are very super sexual and it's about the butt the the brazilian butt having a butt like that yeah they like their butts miss thongs it's the beach right it's a beach community it's a beach culture yeah yeah rio they're fun i like that whole style yeah do it tom dancing garden of all color anymore show me the cam yeah so mean to come are they super religious too though i mean it's a catholic sure country but i mean it's obviously like i mean it's a sexually charged culture yeah what an interesting dichotomy that they're like a deeply catholic place and then also i read this thing one time about um insults in different uh parts of the world yeah and so the origin of insults you know in different parts of the world are cultural right so it has to do with like what what is what it happens and what is the norm and what do people care about in that culture yep and so i don't know what the actual but i was reading this thing and it was like you know in bulgaria it's this and in japan it's this and japan's was like shame based which made sense you know and the insult that said that the article said that in brazil a a one of the common insults basically translated to like you don't even know how to  oh wow like like that was like that's like the worst thing yeah yeah you can't  right no  right yeah that's amazing yeah like how dare you say that to me you can't you don't even know how to  yeah that's a good one yeah so this guy yeah his eyebrows i think this is an older video he looks younger here yeah he looks younger and i wish he would remove his shades i'd like to see his eyes yeah i know what he performs exorcisms what is that it's too powerful he can't show you everything at once i know it makes a lot of sense the telephone okay we're gonna make a real quick video about emoji self pronouns first of all for those of you who don't know i use do the modi tooth emoji self pronouns yeah and we're going to talk about why i don't say this verbally because first of all that was really weird to say tooth and tooth selfie tooth self yeah or as some people call them xeno pronouns that i've uh thank you by the way for those who decided to educate me on that research on it and you are correct because you know pronouns are a thing a lot of people still refer to nounselves and emoji self pronouns as neo pronouns though and since that's more commonly known i will continue i am moving on wait hold on hold on can i tell you that my favorite thing is is that so when these people make a video and then someone's like actually it's called a neo pronoun and then the person has to go thank you for educating me yeah like you can't be like  you you in this whole thing you have to say thank you for educating thank you for the education thank you for educating me so i'd like to thank you for educating me to itself we did not know and i thank you for the education um thank you for educating me you know that there are like voice overact like sometimes you watch commercials and there's a voice over and you it's a familiar voice you're like oh that's kiefer sutherland yeah you know um but then there's the the ones that are really amazing voices but they're not celebrities in

abstract and what a great gig to be the halo guy and you just recorded in a booth and boom you're done working god what a sweet gig best i just saw that clip online that um will arnett yeah i didn't realize he's the gmc voice no yeah so he has this naturally deep voice yeah he has a great great voice but he is the one he can um you know you can throw your voice right he can reach like this like lower pitch or octave whatever it's called and he does like gmc trucks yeah i didn't know that that's awesome yeah he's really i bet he's done a bunch of stuff we don't even know about yeah yeah yeah that's amazing you know who i love when he does voiceover is alec baldwin well he's got that same register basically yeah yeah like i love royal tenon bombs when he does the opening i like baldwin has um like hangover voice yeah you know when you're like oh god the thing is that i uh i just didn't sleep enough last night yeah yeah he has that voice all the time arya wants another baby and is wanting uh baby number ocho yeah i loved him i always he was my favorite of the baldwins yeah yeah you know he's done he's done incredible movies yeah there's this movie he did with kim basinger uh passenger is ambassador i had such a big crush on him growing up and you know i always i remember one time they showed his chest and it was super hairy and i was like oh he's a man yeah he's a man yeah there it is the marrying man i've watched them you know how when so growing up uh when we did there was just cable television and you just were at the mercy of whatever was on cable over and over so i don't even know if i really like that movie i just know that it was on every day in the summer of 90 whatever when i was home that summer so i've seen that movie a million times and i i feel like it it forces your taste you know what i mean like had i not grown up just being in love with him i like baldwin yeah if i was watching some other movie that i wanted to watch yeah no but he also i mean he's a very talented actor yeah he's always like in i mean well he shot that person that was kind of a lot um but even aside from that he is always in tabloids he's like a very tabloid heavy guy is he yeah i don't pay attention first it was that he him and kim had the like a very public divorce and then he's got well he the thing is like i don't know why why paparazzi's always been into him but he's always been one of those people that uh fights with them i don't know he's actually like punched a few of them oh god yeah yeah that's why it's always kim basinger bassinger yeah god she was so beautiful too man stunning god talk about a perfect face too yes she was great so attractive okay what do you think henry cavill or alec baldwin young so go ahead and google can i tell you can i tell you the thing though that i didn't know um like i i just realized that henry cavill was in that uh mission impossible like two of them ago oh didn't register to me as anything but just like another actor it's like he's been part of it is like he is very good looking but i feel like i've been you know when they're like you get told that someone is right and so now it registers like that but if you put like the like yeah he's in mission impossible and i just thought he looked like okay like another actor yeah i know you're saying he didn't like stand out he didn't stand out as i wasn't like look how  good looking this guy is maybe it's the beard did the beard because he that that hides his features i think i i don't think henry can you have a facial hair even there when he did the superman role i was i i didn't know his name but i was like oh that's the guy i was like yes good looking guy please but i didn't go like holy  maybe because his face is so generically perfect yeah maybe yeah like i think because when i say somebody's perfect i mean like that like a stamp oh this is what a perfect human should look like like i thought when we were looking at uh because bert saw thor the other day and he brought up that to me i was like jesus christ but that guy looked way more stand out good looking you know so who are you  that's what i'm saying that guy or well but that's a look at this guy oh yeah guys hats him yeah but i don't i'm not attracted to it but look at him there like in a suit like i've only seen like look normal like he is like really good looking dude no it doesn't do it for me it's not because personally it's not he's he's cute no don't get me wrong he's not objectively handsome yeah it doesn't i don't know it doesn't ring my bell now i did think when i was younger now that you're bringing it up that i thought that alec baldwin looked like a striking handsome man but please pull up alec baldwin young i mean i did think that now here's what alec baldwin too is he's got that he's something interesting happening here it's not totally perfect but there's something masculine sloppy because you know what it is the thing is about men or women um when something is a little more complicated it's more intriguing yeah look at that picture oh like i love him what's he doing in the red background and the chest hair and like um a little bit a little off from perfect can be more attractive than perfect a thousand percent i think i've never  a perfect right like you look at like you look at that henry or the the thor character and you're like you know it looks like they're are drawings that came to life yeah and you're like well they just look perfect right but if somebody has like a little imperfection that's uh almost more it's more engaging you're right i think and i think as it gives them character it gives them yeah something to to dig into look at how look how i see he's how my trend though tom i like blue eyes and i like brunette doesn't i mean the funny thing is though no when you bring up the henry thing ever since he's been talked about more i i do go oh he is like better looking but that mission impossible thing that dude didn't register to me you didn't even see him no because he's so generically handsome yeah because he's not interestingly handsome i don't know he's i mean he's a very handsome man you know yeah but there's interestingly handsome and that's true perfectly him he seems like if if somebody was like show me a perfect man and you'd go like this guy it's like a carbon copy now what about so you know margot robbie is playing barbie she's i think a perfect human beautiful she's beautiful she's like so perfect yeah oh but is that generic too like do you feel the same way about women's faces or is it just men because a woman can't be too perfect right take it for a spin um you're right i mean you can be like no but she doesn't seem like perfect i like her a lot yeah she seems very pretty gorgeous yeah she's perfect but also charlie's tehran perfect you can find photos of her where she looks carbon coffee perfect but then you can also see because she's an actress like a versatile act she's actually a very good actress oh yeah there's um i think there's something more too like she seems like she has more depth than just being a pretty face yeah i think you have to to play the roles that she does yeah yeah you have to you can't just be a dimwit i bet she's you know probably smarter than most people yeah i'm not for most people but like she's got a brain in her  head a thousand percent totally  she is uh she's very very pretty yeah i love watching her and i tonya and she also you know the thing about women too is that like she can look because of hair and everything like so much different from roll to roll too i know you know it's kind of crazy how a haircut or even this right like if i really if i have black hair it just changes your whole vibe and there she is kind of more natural it's probably her natural hair color at the top without bleaching it oh she's gorgeous perfect stunning yeah you can't say anything about it is that her guy who's she banging oh yes his husband tom ackerly who's that is he an aussie too tom ackerly mate british film producer okay oh good girl and uh she knows what she's doing she knows what she's doing she marries a film producer the actress marrying the film producer good idea that's a good move and they don't compete because yeah different you know different vibes he can put her in all of his movies yep oh he's cute oh they're good but he looks like a regular dude he does yeah just like a normal guy yeah he's just a regular guy yeah but he's he's attractively regular yes yeah yeah good for her that means she's a good person she's merely a normal dude okay not like a dummy you know a hot dumdum hot dummy yeah what's up yeah dummy yeah dummy i can't wait to see the barbie movie you know who's in that too yeah ryan gosling oh you always liked ryan gosling love ryan gosling yeah he's always been at the top of your list look at him yeah oh and that's her right yeah yeah i can't wait to see him so he's ken yeah of course hello all right well we did it guys another segment on hotties um okay people will never look like let's get to it oh oh  yeah tell me you weren't expecting that i like that her um uh handle is like

highlighted this tick tock is because usually women don't go this way it's rare it's a cool woman a cool lady yeah okay okay what i don't know how do you feel i mean i did this for you thanks slide into my man's inbox  and i'm gonna slide into gods and let him know you're on your way sis so this was an interesting list it seems like it was a very direct message to somebody to somebody it wasn't just for the public no yeah that those are the most fun can i tell you something she's got really nice eyes really nice eyes yeah and i can't tell if she has teeth or not but i'm kind of i don't care like i think she's pretty enough i think you would go put your eyes yeah you don't have teeth but your eyes yeah that's right very pretty eyes yeah and she's protective of her man i respect that good

hating he's got like a heart choker thing on it looks like a dog collar with a dog identification tag oh so he's into the lifestyle he's some kind of like style and i think too when you when you're like i'm not  you haters i'm not i don't care it's like you kind of did you you do care yeah and you're you're actually letting in the haters know that you can yeah so it's not it's never a good idea unless somebody's going like hey how do you feel about the haters so you're answering the question yeah like you don't just put out a talk saying f all the haters oh you  hate her yeah yeah it's like you're just inviting it that's true you're really sinking to their level you know yep anyway you know i've been banned from tick tock again i keep violating their  died again here's the deal man it's just me posting regular things like i i had a video of me making barbie and ken hump yeah violating community guidelines one time i was just like i watched someone's reaction video some guy doing something dumb and i was like no dude you know just like whatever violating community guidelines they take down all my  if you guys want to see the kind of risque things i'm putting up follow me at the water champ on tick tock i sounded like covertake just then yeah i am unstoppable   tommy this is for you oh oh laughs uh there's so much so gnarly that was one of the most vile things i've ever seen including in the heavy segments should i have saved this for the live show look how gnarly and by the way like why are you wearing open toe shits when everybody can see your your nasty and she's got a toe ring on like that's that's like a hey check this out i know she's decorating it yeah decorating the gnarlies and like it's bizarre to have long tiny nails i mean doesn't it hurt when you put it in a shoe probably why i shouldn't put it in it she took a  gnarly dump she just really had it all  one yellow tacos do you treat your head to the left or the to the right neither the thighs typically keep my head firmly in place it's cool guy humor that is cool guy that's how you like that one it's like pervert like funny cool guy stuff yeah the the honey is typically but this guy doesn't get flagged on tech talk like why doesn't he get flagged for making a  eating joke and like me just making barbie and ken hop is is risque it's disguised enough i don't know  hi happy monday the stanley cup finals start this week my choice colorado west coast so you know how it is but i hate any team from florida now have a good day all bye he hates any team from florida now that i mean that's not very nice not very nice at all no  more exotic pets it's a bobcat look at that mountain foreign do you know what that could do to the cat laying next to it just didn't three seconds just yeah that's a domesticated yeah okay doesn't look too happy to be there hard pass hard pass it's recommended in taking the urine therapy that you only drink your own urine you don't take anybody else's that i know unless it's somebody very very sick and then they would take the urine of a a baby of their own sex of their own sex yeah we've learned a lot today about religious stuff and sex what is it tom did you know those rules about urine therapy i i just yeah you have to drink your own urine and if you're not reading your own urine it's got to be of a baby of the same sex great okay so how do you learn light language i'm going to share my most important tip on how to get started with my language first it's important to note that light language is not something that you learn it's not something that your intellectual mind can wrap its head around it's something that is felt experienced a more of a reremembering of an activation every human being has the ability to reremember how to speak and channel line language in fact children who are very young and still in touch with their soul self you will find them speaking light language and childhood so how can you get started learning light language my most important tip is the biggest thing i've noticed that gets in the way of people being able to activate their own channel is selfjudgment i can definitely understand from a different perspective how light language could seem silly or strange vocalizing very interesting sound she seems so young to be this crazy like if you were telling me this message i'd be like oh the message is coming from somebody like 64 or something you know like she's dead she's lost their mind over a year she's got denver airport vibes but yeah she's not i mean she looks like a  teenager but here's the deal man is that i really like her and her light language videos are  pleasant and they're actually really healing like when i i wanted to not like it and then i was like god i feel so much better like that's the weird thing is that she's not wrong okay your own channel is creating a space within yourself of supportive awareness to support yourself in allowing to express whatever wants to come through so a practice i recommend in order to start activating your vocal channel is take a moment a time out of your day to simply allow yourself to vocalize whatever wants to come through don't sit i mean do i really have to do the normal thing i just want you to get a piece of the light i got a piece i got a piece thank you you really should give it a try before you give up on it i'm not i'm just saying i'll send you some of her videos i don't know if they're in that pile just to feel what it feels like it feels so good she has them for menstrual cramps she has them for like taking her anger away which it looks like you could use right now episode 666 he's coming to an end that's it i don't have any more talks for you no um i don't believe you yeah and that was not one i wanted to end up can we go out on a fun talk at least that's the last one the last one in the match um so yeah we made it we made it to the very final episode of your mom's house because we always wanted to come to just episode 666 uh we are now in lucifer's lair officially um the home that we will spend eternity in here with satan and all of the centers of the world thank you for joining us on this journey yeah thank you it's been really fun and it took a while to get here i can't believe we've done this many episodes of your mom's house i know it's uh that's approximately 12 years jesus and we've really not grown so much not that much not that much i feel like we we are just making fun of stuff the same way and that's really important is that we haven't matured at all that is a very important thing um well that's it uh thank you guys for watching and listening thank you for supporting us in this show and uh we'll see you on the road bye jeans bye mommy and listen to the story i'll tell filled with celebrity leather and pain  well who am i you ask robert paul champagne mother read aloud pornography took her little boy and now i'm a man  here now be you homeless or black or latino you'll piss on me beat me don't say no the thing i want most out of life  oh oh    foreign    did you like that full episode of your mom's house or your jeans as high and tight as it can be i doubt it watch some more clips dude look at that one watch that one right here or maybe here maybe here maybe you should subscribe that way every time a new video gets posted you'll be notified stay in the no jeans subscribe now", "the old narrative 10 years ago was that if you're feeling depressed just smile well if that worked right we would have a lot less depression than we see out right i think you gotta have a dream the school of greatness really yeah please welcome welcome back in one of the school of greatest podcast i'm super excited about our guest today andrew huberman in the house good to see you my friend hey great to be here thank you very excited you're a neuroscientist professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology which is the hardest word to say at stanford you run a lab human lab which is primarily studying brain states such as fear courage anxiety calm and how it can better move in and out of certain things my first question i've been super excited about this interview happening because i'm fascinated by how we think how we feel our emotions how everything is connected in our body and our brains and i'm curious how much does the body control the mind and the mind control the body are they very connected or is the mind in complete control that's a great question the short answer is the body has a huge and profound influence on our mind and the reason is that we often talk about the brain and we think the brain the brain the brain the brain is important but the brain and the spinal cord which is makes up what we call the central nervous system are extensively connected with the body and the body is extensively connected with the brain and spinal cord so the spinal cord is connected to the brain that's right in the back it comes up the neck and it's the actual nerves are connected inside of your brain that's all the way down to the lower back yeah yeah so basically we are a big tube uh or our nervous system is a big tube so your brain obviously is the thing that's shaped like more or less like this and then the spinal cord extends off the back and all that is housed in skull except for two pieces of the brain which are the eyes which are the actually two pieces of the brain that are outside the skull the eyes are part of the brain they are absolutely a part of the brain they are central nervous system so it's eyes brain and spinal cord all connected they're all connected and if you took that out of the body they would all be connected that's right they're contiguous as we said they're just one unit they're one piece that's right and when sometimes they get challenged people say the eyes aren't part of the brain well then that means that the spinal cord is part of the brain too and i want to be really clear this is not semantics there is a genetic program that ensures that early in development during the first trimester when we were all in our mother's bellies the retinas the neural retinas and eyes were deliberately pushed out of the skull and the reason you have those eyes outside your skull is so that you can evaluate things at a great distance from you right because otherwise everything would have to be in contact with you other animals do this mainly using smell we are very visually driven so a lot of our genome is devoted to vision and understanding what's going on at a distance from us and that's afforded us a huge evolutionary advantage to survive to survive because the more that i can anticipate events at a distance the more that i can coordinate with my environment like daytime and nighttime but also when objects are coming at me or things i want to chase and kill or um you know you think about mating behavior and huntergatherer behavior all of that evaluating faces and face facial expressions without actually having to come into contact with people afford a huge evolutionary advantage but i want to make sure that i answer your question thoroughly the nervous system includes the brain which we now know includes the eyes as well the spinal cord and then what's called the peripheral nervous system all the connections with the body and every organ in our body our heart our diaphragm our lungs our spleen our liver all of it is is as we say innervated it receives nerve connections to the brain that's right from the brain and spinal cord so much so that if we were to just dissolve away everything except the nervous system if we had a human nervous system splayed out here on the table in front of us it would look like a human being there would be a connection at every level down to you'd be able to say that's the big toe and that's the pinky and that's where the heart would belong because it's almost like a silhouette of our entire body and so when we think about the nervous system it's really important i think for people to understand that the nervous system is all of that brain and body and all the connections back and forth and you know there have been thousands of years of debates about what's the mind what's the brain etc the mind body problem all that i think it's fair to say in 2020 that states of mind include the brain the activity of the brain and the body those two things coordinate the brain and the body and have a sort of what i call a contract there's a brain body contract that gives rise to things like states of mind so feeling of depression or a feeling of awe or excitement or happiness which is a state of mind is what i'm hearing you saying yeah i i mean we could talk about why an emotional experience is a state of mind that's right i prefer to talk about states and states of mind because they include the brain and body so just by saying mind i don't mean just brain they include the brain and body and also because so when you say start interrupting the brain and body means thought and feeling yeah so you're asking the key questions um emotions are very hard to describe in an objective way whereas states have certain properties that allow us to study them in different laboratories and from one experiment to the next so um some people may have heard this before but we really the brain does really five things we have sensation which is you know we're constantly bombarded with sound waves and light and smells and things and that stuff is ongoing and you can't negotiate that it's just you have these receptors in your body that allow you to evaluate those things a sea turtle has magnetoreception it can navigate by magnetic fields we cannot do that but they can because they sense it you know infrared vision and a pit viper or something so unless you put on you know night vision goggles you can't do that then there's perception which is which sensations you are paying attention to so as you write with your pen if i say what does that pen feel like in your hand now you're perceiving it but the sensation was always there those receptors were always sensing it so the sensation being the actual feeling of the actual visual the perception is your interpretation of the feeling ah so i would say that the perceptions are where your attention is which sensations you're attending to and then you have thoughts and thoughts get a little complicated for us to parse because they are a little bit abstract but thoughts are a combination of our perception whatever it is we're attending to and they have context memory you know they're tacked into our you know they're tapped into our memory systems right because if i say a pen and you're like i don't know what your relationship depends is but mine is kind of a trivial one i write with one but let's say i come from a family that i don't know had a pen factory in germany in the 1930s then there's a whole or you got stabbed by a person right so it's very contextual so thoughts are like perceptions but they carry memory and context thoughts are memory in context yeah they include that and then there are feelings slash emotions and this is where it really starts to get abstract and kind of hazy and where there's still a lot of debate because for instance if i ask you how you're feeling and you say i feel most people say i feel good well what does that mean i mean that's not a feeling so if you ever do personal development work they're always like don't use a don't say good or bad what do you feel and people say well i feel calm and excited or something like you know when and it starts becoming very abstract and so emotions are a real thing and they certainly perhaps more than anything else recruit the brain and the body when we feel depressed we occupy certain postures we feel it in our gut we feel it in our limbs we can feel fatigue we can feel anxious and so the emotions are really where you capture that mind the brain body contract and relationship very very intensely and then the fifth thing is actions and what i love about actions and behaviors is they are very concrete you're writing with your pen now i'm speaking i'm moving my hands you can measure those things you can analyze them we know exactly what the neural pathways are so you've got sensation perception emotions and actions thoughts yep and then of course beneath all that you've got memories and um people always like to raise intuition you know they always say what about that sixth thing intuition and we could talk about intuition but the reason i like to talk about states and the reason we study states in my lab is that states have two properties that are easy to study somewhat compared to emotions and that's how pervasive they are meaning how long lasting they are states tend to have a beginning a middle and an end whereas emotions it's sort of like they're more in combination states are more like the primary colors from which you mix all the you get all the emotions and the other thing is that they have an intensity that we can measure you can have a state of being very alert or very drowsy or asleep and you can say from a one to ten how are you feeling in this state that's right and we can measure that experience yeah that's right and we can correlate it with things like heart rate heart rate variability breathing speed sweating levels of neural activity and brain areas that control wakefulness and so i will be the first to say that i would love to be able to say that in my laboratory we are studying or someday we'll study awe and flow and all those things but those are higher up on the latter than we can get to right now i think with the current technology we can understand states and from there i do believe that we can make a significant dent into certain mental health issues and optimize performance in certain uh you know communities that are trying to optimize performance and in the general public but the states that we're focused on are very concrete for instance alert and focused that would be a wonderful state to understand and be able to direct ourselves toward when we're not feeling alert and focused how to get into that how to get into that state we could talk about tools for that if you like sleep sleep is so powerful and so important i think now people really understand the extent to which it's important in large part because of matt walker's book why we sleep and the important work that he's done in his lab at berkeley and many other labs as well of course so focus sleep creativity stress these are the the kind of core states that we would like to tackle first because we believe we can and then hopefully in my career but if not in my career then maybe one of my scientific offspring or another laboratory you know 10 20 100 years from now we'll be able to understand things like how does one get into a state of um empathy like i mean we could spend the whole hour talking about empathy but it's hard and it's a fascinating topic and it's so important but it's just very hard to understand at a neural level so we're starting with the basics with the confidence that by understanding those basics they will build up to richer representations and understanding of things like empathy someday yeah would you need to be studying the heart as well to understand empathy or does it all come from the mind it's a great question so we to understand any state a we believe that you have to study the brain and the spinal cord and the body so in my lab you know we talk about being neuroscientists for me that means we study the nervous system the whole thing so people who come into my laboratory we put them into vr environments that simulate some experience and i realize it's not as real as being in the actual experience in the real world but you get enough presence especially because it's very visually and auditory auditorily rich in those environments people get what's called presence they forget that they're in a vr environment at least for moments and in that time we're measuring heart rate variability we're measuring sweating we're measuring in many cases we also have electrodes lowered into their brain because we do this with neurosurgery patients and so we have access to the brain we have access to the body and it's really by recording from all these areas of the brain and body that we can get a fuller understanding of what a state of safe focus or stress or anxiety really is if we were just looking in one little corner of the brain or just in just at the heart we wouldn't be able to do that and so that's a kind of a a center piece of our lab is that brain and body the whole nervous system is key you got to look at all of it with with feelings i want to talk about feelings and emotions for a second can a person make it so they never get depressed they never react to um their perception their people's actions towards them where they never get to a state of uh i don't feel good i'm feeling more depressed i'm in a a dark place now i'm stuck in this place is there a way that we could ever defend ourselves against negative stressors negative emotions or are we just are they do we need them as well to have contrast in life well there's sort of two views on this um i'll reveal mine after i um sort of explain the two views one is that these states i guess i'm i'm automatically calling things like depression a state of mind so when i say state of mind i mean brain and body because your body is really feeling it's like the brain is connected to the body right and so if you're saying internally the thought of like i'm depressed i don't feel good or i'm sad or lonely or i'm not good enough the body's going to react is that what i'm understanding absolutely the body is going to manifest what the mind is telling you absolutely the thought the idea you're going to be like i'm sad i'm not good enough you're going to shrink right is that right that's right i mean they're really two forms of depression um sometimes they're intermixed but one is anxietyassociated depression and you you if you've ever experienced it or for anyone that's experienced it they feel agitation in their body and their mind races but in their body so the body is recruited there are also depressive states that people feel very fatigued and exhausted it's been overwhelmed and they also experience that in their body the idea of getting out of bed in the morning is hard um motivating to exercise doing the sorts of things that we know are powerful for pushing back on depression so the body is recruited i think most people would say that depressive states are bad when they bring down the baseline on life just to as a brief aside anytime there's a question about mental health or addiction or trauma or anything one could look at it and make up some argument of low evolutionarily this makes sense we all get depressed but we have to be fair to the person experiencing it of course and have sensitivity that some behaviors will keep the baseline of our life steady meaning job relationships etc will continue as they are other activities will tend to improve the baseline on our life job activities relationship etc will will improve and then there's some things like heroin which does very quickly we can predict that very quickly the baseline on life is going to creep down regardless of who that person is right so people say can you get addicted to water well maybe but i have to drink a lot of water before the baseline of my life starts to go down so sure it feels uncomfortable that's like man i'm so bloated exactly so we tend to throw around things like addiction and depression a little loosely so yeah i think that it's fair to say that depression is wired into us as a possible state that we can all fall into but that it's very important in my opinion that humans have tools to remove themselves from that state of course to avoid your tragedies like suicide but also because when the baseline on someone's life goes down far enough they find it increasingly hard to do the sorts of things that are going to get them out of depression so you or i could say so they stay in that state of depression that's right it's too hard to go work it's too hard to change my habit of eating healthier so i'm going to stay i'm going to keep eating ice cream which is going to make my body you know depressed that's right right if i keep eating bad foods if i keep staying up till 4 am if i keep staying in the toxic relationship i want to feel depressed that's right and eventually because of this very um inseparable relationship between the brain and body eventually what happens is that because the brain controls the body but also the body can control the brain people lose the ability to intervene in this depressive process so you or i could say look if someone who's depressed they what they need to do is get up early get some light in their eyes um get some movement i know you put this information out there which i love because these the those tips are grounded in uh they're not even tips they're really tools and they're very powerful because they're grounded in excellent science you get that dopamine release early in the day that's antidepressive you time your sleep better when you get sun in your eyes and you get movement early in the day for most people that's accessible and they should be they absolutely should be doing it everyone should be doing that but for people who are far enough down that path of depression because the body and the mind have this relationship that's so close there is a crossover point where they really can't do those activities because they're so far deep in the depression the body won't do what they decide to do and so now i'm not trying to give anyone a pass because ultimately we are all responsible for our own mental health certainly adults more than kids but you know we're all responsible for our own mental health and only we can direct our own brain changes that's the stinger once we're you know 25 years and older we are the only ones that can change our brain and we can talk about neuroplasticity if you like but the depressed person has to take responsibility for their behavior but this is why it's so important to catch this brain body relationship early and build routines that keep one out of depression so that was a long path back to answer your question succinctly i hope which is we can stay out of depression but we have to keep depression at bay by doing things regularly the same way we can stay out of obesity by eating the right foods in the right times and ratios and things of that sort but once one is obese there are massive endocrine changes type 2 diabetes that make it hard to eat correctly right right so there's this hard to get out of it it's hard to go back to a healthy state that's right once your insulin is dysregulated you're hungry all the time so it's much harder to control your hunger now you have to have so much discipline and willpower to i guess break through and try to get back to a healthier state that's right is that right it's possible is what i'm hearing you say absolutely but it's really really hard that's right so is depression a disease then are are people who have certain brain chemistry that are born differently with their brains that are just more depressed or is it possible to get out of that state if you have the functionality to think to act to you know move to create routines and habits for yourself is that possible yeah there are some genetic predispositions to depression and there's certainly familial circumstances where you know trauma and challenge that can head people down that path i think you know one of the reasons i'm involved in public education about neurosciences i want people to understand the nervous system and i want them to understand that there are tools that can allow them to intervene in their thoughts and feelings and most of the time those involve bringing in behaviors and the actual actions which are very concrete and the reason is the following it's very hard to control the mind just using thinking it's just choosing the mind just thinking it's very hard you know if someone's stressed out and you say calm down it doesn't work telling ourselves calm down doesn't work so it's like it's a tool breathe right so right so a specific outside for a walk a specific tool right and when it comes to depression and emotions i mean that it's very hard to talk oneself out of an emotional state it's just very challenging very hard that's right it's like when i talk to my girlfriend and she's just like she's not happy about something and she gets on a tangent i'm like there's nothing i can say to calm her down there's nothing i can say to someone who's emotional about an idea in the moment until i'm like okay let's talk later otherwise me trying to tell them to relax no that's not what you're counterproducing it's not you know it's not the truth that's not what you're thinking or whatever it's kind of reactive right makes them more emotional well that's because these states like these emotional states of mind they they recruit the whole nervous system so we are actually a different whole body is out of control your mind your body like for instance if you're angry upset or stressed your pupils dilate this is subconscious as a consequence as a consequence of that you view the world in panic in kind of like portrait mode not panoramic excuse me portrait mode on your phone where the thing that's upsetting you is in sharper focus and everything else is blurry so you actually see the world differently in addition to that the timing that your perception of time excuse me is now faster so that things outside you seem to be moving more slowly in comparison to how you feel inside you've experienced this if you were ever in line at the airport or something and it's taking a long time and you're about to miss your flight it seems like the person in front of you is moving very slowly they're taking forever yeah but time is time it's you know it's moving at the same rate regardless when you're very calm or let's say you're you're fatigued let's say you're exhausted you didn't sleep well the night before things in front of you it seemed like they're moving really fast they're saying take off your shoes putting them on the conveyor it's kind of overwhelming slow down here that's right because your internal clock is moving more slowly yeah and so these states of mind when someone's upset they they recruit their entire being their way of being and so one of the reasons why i mentioned that sensation perception feeling thought in action before is that the actions are very concrete and because of this reciprocal relationship between the brain and body brain connects to body body connects to brain we know that when the mind isn't where we want it to be we need to use the body to intervene what does that mean so there are two ways that you can shift your brain state quickly you mentioned one already which is respiration or breathing and the reason is there's a direct connection from the brain to an organ in our body called the diaphragm which is skeletal muscle the diaphragm is designed to move the lungs up and down bring in more oxygen expel more oxygen and it's unlike other organs like the heart or the spleen or the liver because it's actually made up of what's called striated muscle just like a bicep tricep or quadricep it can be voluntarily controlled you can't voluntarily control your heart directly right now like you can't say speed up and speed it up slow down or slow it down you can slow down your breathing and you can slow down the way you think about things i'm assuming or change your thoughts to something else to help you be more relaxed that's right so one of the reasons why breathing is such a powerful tool for shifting one's state is that a it's always available for voluntary control it's just right there you can i can decide right now to do three inhales or i can just go back to breathing reflexively i can just do that at any moment so the the neural arc you know real estate which is in the brainstem that controls breathing is in a unique position because it's at the kind of boundary between conscious control and unconscious control i can't do that for my digestion i can't do that for most most everything that happens internally the other thing is that breathing controls our level of alertness very dramatically so the faster you breathe generally the more alert you are the slower you breathe the more calm you're gonna be the faster you breathe meaning shorter quick breaths or either way so um so we're just to take a brief um adventure through the the neuroscience of breathing and how it relates to brain states and and there's some fun tools in here so forgive me for this tangent but you have two brain areas that are responsible for breathing one is called for the aficionados the prebutt singer complex it was discovered by jack feldman at ucla it's named after a bottle of wine so now you people won't forget it and it controls rhythmic breathing so inhale exhale inhale exhale it's just rhythmic breathing there's another brain area that controls breathing which is near what's called the parafacial nucleus which involves breathing anytime there are double inhales or double exhales or triple inhales you say well why would you have this second brain area for breathing well turns out when you're speaking or crying or coughing you need to coordinate your breathing with your speaking and that means sometimes you need to take multiple inhales or multiple exhales and this is all happening very very fast you don't notice but there's a very important discovery that was made a few years ago by jack's lab and by a guy named mark krasnow at stanford who discovered there's a set of neurons in your brain stem mind brings them everybody's brainstem and every animal every mammal's brain stem it's a very small number of neurons that controls a specific pattern of breathing which are called physiological size so these are not just sides where you go and exhale these are sides that involve doing two inhales and then an extended exhale we all do this you do this during sleep anytime carbon dioxide levels in your bloodstream get too high in order to get more oxygen into your system people also do this if they've been crying or sobbing they'll do this and then they'll exhale so what's happening with these physiological sides and why is this powerful so your lungs are two big bags of air but they actually are made up of a ton of little sacks of air called the alveoli of the lungs when we are exercising or when we are sleeping or anytime we're doing anything these these little sacks of air eventually start to collapse and what happens is carbon dioxide builds up in our system and we experience that as stress we actually feel the impulse to breathe because carbon dioxide levels get too high there are neurons that sense carbon dioxide and then without realizing it you do the double inhale and then exhale typically the inhales are done through the nose and the exhale is done through the mouth so it looks like and why the second inhale well if you've ever tried to blow up a balloon for a kid at a kid's party or just blowing up a balloon you sometimes blow into that empty balloon what do you do you do two in you do two you go and then it pops open so these double inhales pop open the avioli of the lungs they don't explode them but they pop them open which pulls carbon dioxide out of the bloodstream brings oxygen and then you offload carbon dioxide so if you watch a dog right before it takes a nap or something it often will do these now what's cool about these physiological sizes from work in our lab and that's still ongoing i just want to say it's still ongoing but work in other labs as well double inhales followed by an extended exhale are the fastest way that i'm aware of to bring the mind and the body into a more relaxed state really yeah it is fastest way but if i'm stressed i'm overwhelmed just do a three or two two inhale through the nose and then exhale slow through the middle one to three of those repeated will bring your level of autonomic arousal down basically to baseline what's that onomatic it's called a it's automatic sorry arousal what was it sorry so the autonomic nervous system yeah it just means uh automatic and it's a misnomer because as i'm describing it's not all automatic i'm sorry so autonomic arousal is kind of your level of alertness or your level of calm people sometimes call it sympathetic nervous system parasympathetic i avoid sympathetic parasympathetic because sympathetic sounds like sympathy and then people think it means calm and nice when it actually means stress and sympathetic is stress exactly the naming parasympathetic is nonstress that's right and and those names have to do with the anatomy and the locations of the neurons involved but i think for anyone that experiences anxiety from time to time which is everybody knowing that you can consciously take control over these neurons that control the ratio of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the lungs et cetera even if you don't remember any of that it's just two inhales through the nose what you're trying to do is maximally inflate those little sacs in your lungs and then exhale long through the mouth because you're blowing off carbon dioxide i heard you do a does it matter the cadence because you did a long deep breath and then a shorter not so much that's just your style yeah you're just trying to fill those those as big as you can so the advice that we hear of take a deep breath or just exhale is sort of right but it doesn't capture the the this neural circuit so a lot of what my lab is focused on because there's so many great labs and people doing great stuff in the breath work community patrol mcq and brian mckenzie they're all these incredible people doing this work wim hof yeah but my lab's been mainly focused on what is the neural machinery that controls these brain body states and the reason these physiological sides work is partially because you offload carbon dioxide you reinflate the lungs so when the body has oxygen it's happy when it doesn't have oxygen it gets stressed but the other reason is the most direct and fastest connection between the brain and body for controlling your state of mind is what's called the phrenic nerve phrenic the phrenic nerve connects these neurons that i'm referring to in these two brain centers that control breathing with the diaphragm a lot of people get excited about the vagus nerve and i'm not out to punish the vagus nerve or the veganistas but the truth is the vagus nerve is a very slow system for calming the brain and body it's called the rest and digest pathway people are engaging their vegas all the time when they eat a big meal when the stomach is distended it sends a signal to the brain that oh i have enough food it's time to rest and digest but eating first of all if you're only using food as a way to control your stress that's not going to happen it's not a good habit you'll be depressed that's right people have learned long ago thousands of years ago that the best way to suppress a cortisol response is with carbohydrates because it blunts cortisol but this is why people eat carbohydraterich foods when they're stressed and when cortisol is spiked what happens so every morning when you wake up there's a cortisol spike that's a good question it's also a breast spike it's like a it's a good one it's the one that wakes you up out of sleep and you want that early in the day you're not just like groggy all day right that's right cortisol has important positive health promoting functions there's a signature of depression and anxiety however that the psychiatrists know about which is a 9 pm cortisol spike there for people who are depressed there's a second spike of cortisol late in the day and that's problematic and is associated with a lot of mental health issues cortisol is a stress hormone is that right cortisol is a stress hormone so you have your adrenal glands which are right above your kidneys and your lower back and they agree they have the two parts to it they release adrenaline which is also called epinephrine and adrenaline is what makes you feel agitated once you you know if you're calm you're walking along you look at your phone and there's a troubling text message you immediately have focus energy and alertness is the brain connected to those then and it sends a signal to each other that's right really and then it affects the body that's right too when the body feels it that's right so adrenaline is liberated into the body very fast in less than a second half of 500 milliliters if you see something you're reacting to it and it's just boom that's right and it recruits a set of neurons that live right in the core of your body they then send the signal out to your body and all of a sudden you feel like you want to move and let's go the stress is just it's going to dilate your pupils cue your alertness and make you agitate and want to move the body is pretty fascinating it's really fascinating and you want this because you know um the other night i was taking a hike um i was out here a couple days ago and taking a hike in topanga and i saw a shadow i looked down and did move it was a snake it wasn't a rattlesnake but but still all that happened in less than a second right and these are primitive pathways designed to get you to your alertness your my night vision is so so but all of a sudden i felt like i could see clearly and you just that's adrenaline cortisol is a bit more slow acting so when that adrenaline is up over and over and over again for days and days cortisol starts getting liberated from also from the adrenals it comes from other places too but mainly from the adrenals and the cortisol system is an antiinflammation system as well as an inflammation system but it's both it's both but people you know they give cortisone shots to football players you know in the locker room for a reason um it blocks pain and all these things so the but too much of it over extended period of time does what it can cause chronic inflammation it can cause chronic fatigue i mean there is a debate out there most serious mds don't believe in adrenal burnout people think of adrenal burnout there is something real fatigue or adrenal burnout so there is something called adrenal insufficiency syndrome which is a real medical phenomenon where the adrenals are incapable of making these cortisol and adrenal hormones but the the truth is that you have enough adrenaline and cortisol in your body you'll last two lifetimes and 25 famines i mean we were built with a lot of robustness right this explains you know that you know the david goggins of the world they they you know we we all do have that greater capacity that people talk about the stress is very misunderstood because people think of stress as this ancient carryover that's very unfortunate it kind of gets lumped with depression like oh this is just a flaw in our design or something but actually stress is wonderful it actually activates our immune system so anytime you liberate adrenaline into your bloodstream you also protect yourself against infection of bacteria and viruses because if you think about if we had to gather food and we didn't have it and we had to then pack up and you know migrate long distances you can't afford to get sick and this is why people who work work work work and then rest they usually get sick when they finally stop and rest yeah it's like the post finals phenomenon in university or after the season for a game or the caretakers thing where you're taking care of somebody who's ill and you're just work work work or taking care of young children and then you finally stop to rest you go on vacation and you get slammed with with what is that because you're being in your comfort zone now are you getting a stress turned off and adrenaline so that these the stress response recruits the immune organs of the body to release killer t cells in fact wim hof breathing i know you're familiar with whim of doing 20 or 30 deep inhales and exhales and also combined with some breath hold type work exhale hold inhale hold is known to stimulate adrenaline release and the one of the better papers that's out there scientific peerreviewed papers is a study published in the proceedings in the national academy of sciences where they brought in two groups one group um did wim hof breathing the other group did just uh mindful meditation both groups were injected with e coli right crazy right it's crazy the meditators got fever diarrhea and and um and vomiting and the people who did wim hof either didn't get it or got it to a much lesser extent sluggish but that's right they didn't right this is not an experiment to do at home isn't this crazy but it makes perfect sense because it inc that breathing simulates a stress response it stimulates cortisol and adrenaline which signals protects the body right which signals to the thymus the spleen and the other you know the the nodes of the immune system to liberate killer cells and so when that bacteria comes in the system is ready for it your body is defending against viruses that's right disease that's right essentially when you create a routine of healthy stress that's right and and we can talk about we definitely want to you don't want stress on all the time sleep is really important etc but that stress response combats infection because it recruits immune cells now i want to be really clear because there's been a lot of discussion about that study out there most of which is totally wrong and i'm not off the breathing study the study was done correctly um but when people re recap that study and summarize it oftentimes they'll say it suppressed the immune response that people were able to suppress the immune response and that's absolutely wrong what does that mean suppress the immunity well exactly it doesn't make any sense what what that did was and if you look at the graphs in that paper which i've done what it did is it stimulated cortisol release it stimulated adrenaline release or epinephrine release so that the system was primed to battle infection and so i think it's a very impressive thing and you know hats off to whim for discovering and thinking about a way to recruit the what's called the innate immune system before that study it was thought that you couldn't really recruit the immune system in that way now you don't have to do that breathing you could if you like but you don't have to do that breathing to recruit the immune response what else could you do a cold shower or an ice bath is another way to induce stress which is what he does exactly exactly and so i think that um you know when you look at states of stress i mean they're cold water is one way to do it um intense what's the breathing that they do that sort of wim hof breathing is also classically called tumor breathing it's kind of the opposite of the physiological side that i described the double inhale exhale because it's not designed to to reduce stress it's actually designed to increase your level of alertness and it's interesting because a lot of people find great relief from stress by doing this tumor type wim hof intense breathing once a day now the reason i suggest physiological size is they can be done in real time you can get into the elevator and do a physiological site you could also do tumor type breathing in any moment you can do that right exactly whereas the more intense forms of breathing are more of a practice that you do might take 10 20 minutes what they tend to do and what cold showers and ice baths and things like that do is they raise the ceiling on your stress threshold and what i mean by that is throughout the day and throughout the year we're confronted with different things right now we're confronted with a lot of things 2020 is the year of being confronted with stress of various kinds the mind plays an important role in interpreting whether or not it's overwhelming or tolerable so intense breathing like tumor breathing or ice baths or cold showers or intense exercise like you know high intensity interval training type stuff teaches the mind to be comfortable in these higher stress states where in other words it teaches people to be comfortable when they have a lot of adrenaline in their body this is like is basically stress inoculation but stress inoculation is not about not getting stressed it's actually about divorcing the mindbody relationship a bit so that you're calm in the mind when your body is very amplified yeah so if you've ever done tumor type breathing or you've done a cold shower the goal is to get the adrenaline release and then calm your mind and then calm your mind and stay in the ice now like i'm exhausted i'm freezing but more like no i can handle this that's right that's right and have power over your thoughts and your mind so that you can have more control of your body obviously you're gonna feel cold right but if you can but i mean does the mind have a hundred percent power over what the body feels no but it doesn't mean that it doesn't have a significant control over it say i feel cold and ice right right i mean ice it's 30 degrees can i control my mind to say you know what this is actually a hot tub and you feel warm and you're feeling hot right now or is it too much physiological barriers to break through that uh to some extent you can so i think um the question that you're asking is a very important one it's actually the question which is to what extent does our subjective narrative the story the story we tell ourselves actually means something for the body and to what extent does the body actually mean something for the subjective narrative so this gets into some areas of work that we're doing now and so i do want to highlight that it's ongoing work but i think you know the old narrative meaning a few ten years ago was that if you're feeling depressed just smile well if that worked right we would have a lot less depression than we see out right right now that does not mean most people actually who are depressed just aren't smiling as well like when you change your physiology doesn't it also start to change the way you think about yourself a little bit the reason i call it a brain body contract early on is that their the brain and the body are constantly in dialogue so you know the idea that when we're depressed we tend to be in more defensive type postures when we're feeling good we tend to be in more like relaxed and extended postures all true but it does not mean that just by occupying the extended posture that i'm going to completely shift the mind right that's a first step think about like two interlocking gears it's one gear that turns the other but then they need to kind of dance together before you can get the whole system going and how do you get it to dance together exactly so subjective there is one way in which subjective thought and deliberate thought is very powerful over states of mind and body to answer your question can you think your way out of the ice bath being cold so a couple things that are important first of all just to go a little deeper on what thoughts are thoughts happen spontaneously all the time they're popping up like a poorly filtered internet connection but thoughts can also be deliberately introduced for instance right now i can say okay have a thought that um just decide to write your name and your you can do that i'm going to decide to write my name and you can do it so that's a deliberate thought which says that you can introduce thoughts so i think it's very hard to control negative thoughts directly by trying to suppress them ten generally they tend to just want to continue to geyser up all the time but we can introduce a positive thought can you think of two thoughts at the same time probably not so you can only have one thought at a time right but they come very fast but it comes and goes right have to you have to constantly be intentional and deliberate about what you think otherwise and a spontaneous thought will pop back into based on your experience based on sensory based on how you're feeling or perceiving something your environment it's just gonna keep popping in right so how do we deliberately have a positive thought more often right so i'm a big fan of wellness and and i think it's a great community but it tends to run in absolutes and there and there aren't a lot of operational definitions as we say in science and i what i love about your question is you're asking for really getting to the meat of things asking for the operational definitions one of the most dangerous ideas in wellness and in popular psychology is that your body hears every thought you have what a terrible thing to put on people you know what what a challenging thing i don't think people should try and suppress their negative thoughts i think there is great value however to introducing positive thought schemes now the reason is not because i think it's just because i think so but because there's actually a neurochemical basis for controlling stress and actually making stress more tolerable and extending one's ability to be in bouts of effort and that relates to the dopamine pathway so the molecule dopamine is a reward it's released in the brain when you win a game you you know close a deal you someone like to love your life someone likes you likes your photo the great love of your life you complete something but most of our dopamine release is not from achieving goals it's actually released when we are enroute to our goals we're in pursuit of our goals and we think we're on the right path this is why a lot of people get depressed after they achieve a big goal because they feel like i'm supposed to feel something greater i felt this thing for two minutes and now that's it that's right high achievers know to attach dopamine to the effort process to the pursuit the daytoday tasks the the growth the lessons the losses like everything right well and it can be to some wins along the way but growth mindset which is the academic discovery and laboratory discovery of my colleague carol dweck at stanford is the hallmark of growth mindset is really two things one is i'm not where i want to be now but i but i will i'm capable of getting there eventually the other is to attach a sense of reward to the effort process itself in fact don't reward the result reward the effort that's right and if you look at true high performers people that are consistently good at what they do they don't peek and go through the post partum depression and crash and come back and their life is a cycle of ups and downs but really people who are on that upward trajectory consistently those people attached dopamine to the effort process and actually carol's one of her original studies on the discovery of growth mindset was these kids that loved doing math problems that they knew they couldn't get right so it's like the people love puzzles but in this case they knew they couldn't get it right but they loved doing it and it incidentally or not so instead only these kids are fantastic at math when there is a right answer because they're they feel some sense of reward from the effort process yeah now the cool thing about dopamine is that it's very subjectively controlled we can all learn to secrete dopamine in our brain in response to things that are in a purely subjective way our interpretation our interpretation and but it has to be attached to reality so you know one should never confuse what is real right so no so if you're if you're thinking about the effort you're expending so let's say somebody right now is financially back on their heels and they're setting up a new business for instance and it's hard if they can take a few moments or minutes each day to reflect on the fact that the effort process is allowing them to climb out of their hole potentially that it's giving them an opportunity that it's somehow they are on the right path or there or if they're not in movement along that path or at least oriented on the right path they're not lying in bed all day they're taking their heels they're taking a step if they can reward that process internally two things happen first of all the brain circuits that are associated with building subjective rewards and dopamine get stronger so you get better at that process and second and most importantly dopamine has an amazing ability to buffer adrenaline and buffer epinephrine and what i mean by that is there was a study that was published in the journal cell excellent journal cell press journal a couple years ago showing that with repeated bouts of effort we use and we release more and more epinephrine it's kind of adrenaline but in the brain with more effort every time every time you put in effort so every time you make look for this let's keep it if i were to keep it in the business context every time you make to write that email every time you let's see it's a person who's a craftsman or a craftsman every time you're working in the in the shop and doing that every bit of effort you're taking a little bit of money out of this epinephrine account you're spending epinephrine at some point those levels of epinephrine get high enough that you you feel like quitting it feels exhausted this was done in a beautiful study actually where um they control the visual environments and they have the subjects ex exert effort and they can control the visual environment so sometimes the effort of taking steps and moving forward is actually kind of pushing forward and kind of swimming motion um would give them the sensation that they were actually making progress and other times it was an exercise in futility where they would just keep the the visual world stationary and they would expend effort and they didn't think they were going anywhere epinephrine's climbing climbing climbing and eventually they quit now dopamine is able to push back on that epinephrine and give you anyone the the feeling that you could continue and maybe even the feeling that you want to continue and you've seen this actually football is a good example two teams play say the super bowl both teams are max effort the entire time yeah max effort the team that wins suddenly in a moment has the energy to jump all over the place party for days they can talk i mean they they they should right before that well that wasn't glycogen or stored energy of any kind except it was neural energy and what happened was effort is this adrenaline adrenaline adrenaline adrenaline eventually people quit they just quit the dopamine is able to suppress that and so then you're expending effort but you're doing it from a place of feeling like you have energy for it so we need dopamine to keep the effort going that's what i'm hearing that's right dopamine is not just about reward it's one of the biggest misconceptions dopamine is about motivation and drive it's like a jet that propels you along a path how do we get more dopamine you practice subjectively releasing dopamine in your mind like wow okay so that's a great question first of all there are ways you can get more dopamine release through thoughts or through drugs or through supplements i want to be really clear there is a drug there are two drugs actually that will cause massive release of dopamine they're called cocaine and methamphetamine the problem gets us addicted because it feels so good the problem is exactly the problem is cocaine and methamphetamine stimulate so much dopamine release that the drug becomes the only source it becomes the goal it becomes the path and the destination and you look at people's lives when they do a lot of cocaine and methamphetamine and that baseline on their life goes down because there's no reason to work hard at anything else because you feel good that's right and that's the greatest feeling you'll have so why do anything else when you can have that feeling that's right and if you think about do remember these neurochemical systems adrenaline cortisol dopamine epinephrine they weren't designed to keep us safe from tigers and to hunt and gather or to build fortune 500 companies they were designed to do anything they were designed to be generic so that depending on our circumstances we could adapt so in an animal context an animal that let's say is hunting where it needs food for its young it's gonna feel agitation that's stress that's cortisol it's like hunger my babies might not eat i might not eat maybe it's looking for a mate it's gonna feel agitation and start looking and roaming and searching foraging is called the animal behavior world it's foraging at some point it might catch a smell of something a potential mate or berries or a stream if it's thirsty at that moment dopamine is released and now it has energy to continue along that path whereas there's a specific pathway in the brain and that's involved in depression and disappointment that if it goes to that place and turns out it was the wrong path there's a signal that actually suppresses dopamine so that you don't repeat that mistake again so you don't give up that's right you just don't repeat it again that's right and those events that reminds you like that's not the path to go down that's right interesting and we're sort of veering towards neuroplasticity here which is the brain's ability to change itself in response to experience dopamine is one of the strongest triggers of neuroplasticity because it says those actions led to success previously you're going to repeat those those actions led to failure previously and don't repeat those so dopamine triggers us to stay on the right path that's right so you asked how do you do this so to really make it concrete and is there too much is there too much thing is there such thing as too much dopamine well if you're not on drugs so cocaine amphetamine are bad because they lower the baseline on life they make people very focused on things outside of themselves that's the other thing that dopamine does it can be positive or negative but when we have dopamine in our system we tend to be outward facing and in pursuit of things in our environment you can look at somebody on cocaine and realize that that's the extreme version of that but but that you know i love social media for the reason that you see the molecules in the memes so it's like get after it you know what do sharks do on monday or i can't remember the specific things or then they're the like sometimes it's just time to chill well that's a different molecule that's serotonin right and then dopamine is the get after it molecule and epinephrine is effort so if we were to break this down really concrete we'd say adrenaline and epinephrine are about effort just effort with no subjective label on them good or bad effort whether or not stress or you're pursuing something you want to do it's just it's in exerting effort dopamine is about reward but more so about motivation and pursuit of rewards and then we'll get to it in a little bit but serotonin is a different source of reward but it comes from more relaxed states and it resets the whole system and it's associated with things like sleep and gratitude and meditation and especially gratitude and then just i guess to round this out the cortisol system is more of a like a longer term stress yeah okay so we've all heard the sayings you know how do you you know journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step or how do you eat an elephant one bite at a time or you know they're all these sayings and it goes back to the bible and earlier right i mean this is not new these are not new sayings but they're showing up in different forms what's lost in those short descriptions however is that every step is not equivalent if it were just that a journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step everyone would pursue their goals everyone would push back against adversity everyone i mean you can read the inspirational stories as many times as one needs and i do think inspirational stories are very high value in fact i think they're vicarious dopamine i think they give us the sense that we could which then orients hope which then orients us to the world they start yeah it's maybe it's possible for me that's right so let's say um let's take the example of somebody who's um because we're finished that's that story of it's not about just taking a single step and one step at a time is it because there's adversities every 10 steps you go and so it's harder and harder well it's just very nonlinear you know it's it's some days go you know i know this from my scientific career to you know some days it's easy some day is hard it's all over the place right so i think the thing to remember is that dopamine is this incredibly powerful molecule that allows us to buffer the effort process it allows us to be an effort longer and it allows us to actually eventually enjoy the process of effort and not think about the reward but just say oh i'm enjoying the process right well you just described the first step the first step in learning to attach dopamine to the effort process which is the key operation in order to succeed is to be very careful about how much you focus on the end goal keeping the goal in mind is important for like a proper orientation you have to know the ultimate destination but if at any point we were to evaluate our progress relative to that end goal or if we don't know what the end goal is there's a huge gap there and it can feel overwhelming and depressing and i'm not good enough that's why i should just give up what am i doing this for that's right those thoughts will affect us and they're very realistic right i mean as carol will say and other people have said in the psychology field you know positive selftalk oftentimes unless you do it correctly you're badly wrong you know lying to yourself won't work saying saying i'm i'm a winner i'm a winner i'm a winner when you haven't lost or you haven't won yet is is great but that's not the most effective use of these systems well you're also being out of integrity with yourself you're you're telling yourself a lie right you're like and then you're losing your ability to have confidence because you just lined yourself right and if it's really extreme there's a name for it's called delusional right right and people will start to point that out and then it becomes harder to recruit people into your your goals so i think the key thing is to attach that sense of reward to the effort process it's saying look i am oriented in the right direction and rewarding the things you're not doing i'm not back on my heels i'm not just staying you know i'm bad a good example this came to me recently i have a good friend he did nine years in the seal teams his name is pat doss and and we were talking about you know the admiral mcraven thing you know get up and make your bed and you know and they they really do that and i think the way it was described was um you know so at the end of the day even if everything doesn't go well your bed is still made for me that's not that big of a reward frankly right but i and so i said that and i i love it though i make my bed i mean oh i definitely made my bed in the morning but i mean going back and seeing that at the end of a hard day it's not enough i felt like there was something else there so i asked him he said well it's very interesting because part of it is about not just making your bed but it's the things you're not doing by making your bed you're not lying in bed and ruminating you're not back on your heels on your phone that's right yeah when so when you look at and you have spent a lot of time with people in high performing communities mainly through some consulting work but what you find is that you know we can all be either be back on our heels flatfooted or forwardcentered and when you look at people who are in these high performance communities they try and keep their center of mass forward almost through what seem like trivial things like making your bed or making the cup of coffee but it's not just about what you're doing it's all the things you're not doing that can put you down the path of ruminating or put you down the path of um unhealthy behavior so the key to this is if we want to be very concrete we should probably focus on actions and i'll use fitness as an example because it translates to everybody whereas you know people's circumstances differ let's say somebody really wants to take on a fitness routine they hate running or they want to lose weight in a healthy way this kind of thing so we've all heard the example well you put your shoes by the door on day one day two you put them on day three you go out the door day four you walk around the block and then you know and then eventually like they're running marathons okay great but to sustain that behavior or even to make the behavior pleasurable and to give you energy the key is to subjectively reward those steps so it's not going to be let's say i go out and i run a mile and my goal is to run 10 miles in a few weeks the key is as you're in the strain of that mile the hard part you want to tell yourself this is the good part this is the part that gives me energy and i'll be very surprised if people don't actually feel like they could continue further so it's a journey of a thousand miles starts with a single is made up of you know single steps but the key is to reward the harder steps not the easier ones and not the ones where you get the thing that you want don't reward yourself for putting your shoes on and taking a step outside you could if that was a huge barrier for you it was very hard it was very hard for you running the ten miles that's right find the wall and push a little bit further through that wall and reward that process so this is why i think reps in the gym the final reps like reps to failure are usually not the best example first of all most people aren't doing reps to failure and it doesn't translate to young kids and stuff where they probably shouldn't be doing heavy reps to failure this kind of thing what you want however is if you're going to go there to think about these are the this is the hard part because that's when adrenaline norepinephrine are getting maxed out and that's when you have an opportunity to bring dopamine in and teach those neural pathways to slam that back down and i don't want to um highlight them too much because they are a very niche and specialized community but you look at people in special operations you look at the process like the whole evaluation process of who gets in and who doesn't it's really about putting people into stress and seeing who can not just make it through that stress but buffer that stress reward the process through teamwork reward the process of stress through some internal dialogue that has everything to do with not being back on your heels not being flatfooted but center of mass forward and i should also be clear i'm not talking about everybody being super aggro and always like you know work work in fact if you're spending too much epinephrine if you're too much of an adrenaline junkie you will burn out eventually unless you can find ways to recover yourself or to buffer that with dopamine and the recovery process is especially important there's a second reward system so you've got the dopamine system and i guess to really put a box around it the subjective reward needs to be done at the hardest portion of a process the tough conversation with a significant other it's like when it's really tough and you want you just that's when you want to start telling yourself this is the this is the good part because i'm not speaking or this is the good part because i'm not reacting right i'm not reacting or this is the good part because i'm probably not doing it correctly but i'm on the right path right they're upset they're not feeling your empathy you know this kind of thing or you're not really understanding what's going on you're getting frustrated but if you tell yourself this is this is the neural pathway getting ground in there like really dialed in so that the the next time this i'm going to breeze right past this that's really how the process works because dope remember no one comes along and drips dopamine in your ear even if you get a billion dollars or you win a nobel prize or you win the presidency it's all internal these neurochemicals are all internal and while some of them are designed to be released in response to things very reflexively like um you know food sex sleep you know all these things will trigger these neurochemicals we have this big forebrain which allows us to place subjective context on things how do you do it then how do you bring dope meaning in your brain subjectively through daily conversation with yourself so um there's a process i'm going through right now where i'm trying to write a book and um it's hard and it's hard and i was told that the harder it is the better i'm probably doing it and i was like great and my editor's ready to kill me and because i'm slow and i and i know and i'm a very slow person i i i drive people crazy i'm like glacially slow because science is slow and i like to get things right rush it yeah i like to get things right but i'm very proud of the fact that everything we've published i can stand behind it was the best we could do with the tools at the time and i just know that when i look back on a writing career or scientific career i want to be able to say you know every journal we put it in was rock solid everything was rock solid we had fun doing it the relationship so i go slow yeah but as a consequence what i'm finding is there are a lot of interferences these days i'm i'm i think social media is great i teach neuroscience on social media because i think it's important to do public education too but it's incredible and it's it's incredible how much time and energy it can take so what i've started doing now is i turn off my phone and i lock it in a safe and i experience extreme anxiety right it's so weird why is that is it because it gives you so much dopamine that when you're not having it well this is scary because i actually think um brief anecdote on the weekend i was driving there's a kid that i mentor and i picked up my phone and i was texting while i was driving and he said to me it was really embarrassing for me he said you know i wish you wouldn't text while you drive and i put it and i put it down and i realized this is crazy i know that i that my life in his life is far more important and the lives of the people around me are far more important than any text message which means i wasn't doing it rationally it's just pure reflex at this point so i would i don't think i pick up the phone because i'm i don't even know what i'm looking for there anymore it's just become reflexive so for me lately the longer i can keep that phone in a safe and write on a grant or my or this book what i tell myself is the agitation is good i'm it's at least i'm not doing that and then i find that as i start to write and i get into the process i start feeling good about it and i'll pause and say okay i have control i have ultimate control over my behavior i can put that thing away there might be a nuclear war out there and i'm just doing this anyway i have control over my thoughts my feelings and behavior so i tell myself that and then i find i have immense energy and all i want to do is write and i kind of tunnel into the process wow and i think that sometimes people need to write these things out for themselves so it's really concrete i think some people are so unskilled at subjective rewards that writing it out is really powerful so what would you write out for yourself as a subjective reward for this experience as long as i'm writing i'm on the right path as long as i'm not writing and looking at my phone i'm not on the right path because for me the the two or three things that are most important for my career are writing grants working on this book manuscript and writing scientific manuscripts i mean there are other things that's great anything else that you're not doing is is holding you back from doing that that's right so you need to be focused center mass forward on doing those things that's right so i don't do any jumping around power poses things like that i will use tools to kind of ramp up my dope i mean there are certain songs that are really embedded in my emotionally my emotional thing that go back to you know when i was a you know while you know skateboarding punk rock teenager that will get me fired up and i think there's real utility that's pure dopamine that's just dominance but it's not sustainable you have to subjectively keep yourself motivated i guess that's right and so and then if i finish a chapter i will stop for a moment and i'll just kind of smile and laugh at myself i'm big on like selfreflection with humor and just thinking this is crazy you know my brain is under my control there would be people out there that say there's no free will but i do not believe that i put my hands in a lot of brains you stimulate certain brain areas people do things you stimulate other brain areas people think things ultimately unless you have electrodes in your head and someone's stimulating them we are in control of our thoughts and behaviors we can't control all of them but my goal is to be as you know deliberate and nonreflexive as possible in life that's my goal from when i wake up in the morning until i go to sleep how do we get to that place little by little and by rewarding each thing if you get up and you used to make the bed exam make the bed you're you're not back on your heels you make a cup of coffee you sit down you script out something in a journal you exercise maybe you call a relative that you think might need to hear from you or that you'd like to talk to you do something in a deliberate way just being deliberate and learning to push away the things that are trying to make you reflexive is so important i think the same thing as reactive or what's reflective yeah so um there are two modes of brain operations so now this is um getting a little nittygritty but one is deliberate where we're in thinking duration path and outcome what should i do what you know how long should i do it and what's the outcome deliberate yeah intentional and it feels like work this is what people need to understand that deliberate thought deliberate action writing the book doing the work out you don't want to do whatever it is having the conversation it's supposed to feel hard supposed to feel hard but you should subjectively reward it so that you get better at doing that so it's supposed to feel hard because it's associated with this release of these neurochemicals that create this agitation the mental strain you feel when you're learning something is the trigger for neural plasticity for your brain to change it let's say that again the mental strain you feel while doing something is the what is the trigger for neural plasticity which neuroplasticity allows you to expand your mind to do more things that's right so neuroplasticity is a process of taking something where there's duration path and outcome where i'm working hard i'm thinking hard maybe it's a hard conversation maybe it's a business plan maybe it's a scientific career and the goal of neuroplasticity is to make things reflexive so you don't have to think about them right for instance i just started taking spanish class oneonone and it's extremely hard it makes me want to say why am i doing this this is going to take me years until i'm conversational who knows how long so i'm fluent you know if it's this hard as like this stage man is it ever going to get easier i have those moments every time i'm doing class i'm like this sucks right because i'm because i'm like oh i'm 37 can i learn this language it's so much easier when you're five now it's almost impossible i watched your video on this a couple days ago on social media and and the video you talked about this is yes it's harder when you're older to expand your neuroplasticity but it's going it's almost the what i'm hearing you say is like it's the only way to live is the order you get you need to constantly be expanding it otherwise you'll be going backwards that's right so you know when you want to learn something new like spanish or new physical skill your mind shifts over the forebrain comes on and says okay we're going to pay attention to things and now what am i doing and i get so tired i'm like and we get and we start doing evaluative stuff to other people to ourself and you can start using all sorts of examples like wait you know i was a professional athlete in your case or i want to be clear i was never a professional athlete but you were a professional athlete you've been successful in other regimes of life but it still feels like effort right yeah and so but that effort is because two things are happening one is adrenaline epinephrine is being released so it doesn't feel great it's not fun it's like and then in addition to that by bringing focus to something you're recruiting a neuromodulator called acetylcholine which is associated which is the molecule of focus now it's important it takes energy and effort it takes energy and effort you feel it in your body and in your brain and it tends to highlight acetylcholine will highlight the areas of your brain that are active during that learning phase when the teacher is talking or you're talking and making that effort it's paying attention how you're moving your mouth what it sounds like to you feedback cues and it's marking those brain areas for change and then later when you sleep or when you work out or when you're having a conversation with somebody that's actually when the brain changes occur so during the actual activity that's right it's when you're not doing the activity resting or recovering when it starts to expand or it starts to it's when the so neuroplasticity which is the brain's ability to change in response to experience and is the main way in which we go from deliberate action duration path outcome stuff to reflexive action and thought that process has two parts one is the trigger which is in adults is triggered by focus and attention and even a heightened state of agitation the more frustrated you feel the more you're actually triggering learning it's saying this is important this is important because the brain just wants to do whatever it wants to do it needs to cue itself to oh this must need to change and then the second part is deep relaxation meditation in particular a form of meditation called yoga nidra which we could talk about but forms of deep relaxation deep sleep like slow wave sleep that's when the connections between neurons called synapses actually get stronger that's when the the connections that you don't want get removed and that's also in certain cases where you get new neurons actually born in your brain to help these circuits speak spanish this is why in sports growing up i remember i would go to like basketball camps in the summer and i would always learn new footwork and i always just wanted to be like the fancy guy doing like whatever uh finger roll layups or something as a kid but then we would go to these basketball camps and we'd just work on the fundamentals and the footwork and like all this different stuff and i remember being in the moment of being very frustrating and challenging i was like i don't get this and i would suck at it but then the next day i'd come back and i would all of a sudden like have it after a few times of doing it but i never learned how to do it in the moment it was always like okay i made it got it once but then i fumbled on it it was the next day or the next few days where it's like oh i can just shows up it shows it just shows up and that's because when the mind is able to relax it's then making the connections on how to do that thing yeah so in deep deep sleep and rest is when the connections actually get built up it's sort of like in with um resistance training right the gym is a little misleading resistant training because people get the you know the famous pump and so they get they get a visual glimpse into what they might look like later but then of course it goes back down right um but so but actual hypertrophy the enlargement of the muscle fibers and the strengthening of the neural connectivity connection is later when you sleep so it's the same thing with neuroplasticity yeah so important is it for us to constantly be learning and challenging our mind the older we get well i believe it's very important for living a full life and you know my hero in this uh two heroes actually is i would say um richard feynman the great physicist who had a very playful attitude about learning that's one thing that i really should illustrate if you are in frustration and strain a sense of play is great because in play you have focus you have intention and alertness and it keeps you light enough that there's that dopamine release is dopamine is released in play for a reason because kids and animals young animals and young children learn social interactions through play yeah a puppy bites another puppy and it the puppy barks out loud that's why they have those sharp puppy teeth to say that's too much of a bite then they play a little bit more it's their phone they're finding the boundaries they're finding the the limits to which they can use physical force for hurting another or just for playing they learn soft bite play in animals is an ancient form of sampling these neural pathways and as adults we tend to be more demanding of ourselves we don't tend to embrace as much play richard feynman is somebody who really um incorporated a lot of play into his adult life he learned how to in addition to being a nobel prize winning physicist he also you know played bongo drums he would be learned how to sketch and paint late in his life he didn't float tanks he was kind of a wild man but he had a lot of fun and he was a lifetime learner so i think it's important because it's a great way to learn dopamine release right and it's a great way to um expand one's experience of life this is when we're when i was in poland with wim hof earlier this year i took a group of like 13 guys and we were all nervous to get into this ice club together for 10 minutes like up to here and for the first two minutes it was not fun we were just like this sucks this is cold but then all of a sudden we were like let's have fun we're gonna be in here for eight more minutes we might as well try to enjoy it so we started chanting we started singing we started like just like in a rhythm together like smiling and it was like it's more enjoyable it's still going to be challenging but you might as well try to have the most fun in the challenge than just suffer right yeah team and community um not by coincidence is a powerful tool for buffering stress um again you know look at high performing teams like seal teams or other special operations units they the team is a big part of it for being functional in the actual job it must be impossible to do it alone if you're a new navy seal yeah there are other divisions of special operations where actually it's more focused on solo missions yeah where and so there are people that are very good at that but teamwork is a great way to buffer the stress response yeah and so earlier you asked is there any way to make it not cold uh i guess the answer is no but there is a way to make the cold not painful right and so that's where dopamine intervenes the other thing that's important because we talked about neuroplasticity you trigger it with focus and energy you know and effort and strain is you know children can learn very easily their brain is hyperplastic and very quickly is t the whole job of the young brain is to take things that it's taught and very quickly pass it over to reflex including right morals and beliefs automatically yeah this is what's scary it's also you know the things that kids hear and they believe and they're exposed to those beliefs become reflexive now around age 25 or so the brain is still plastic and forever for the entire life but then you need more focus and you need what's called selfdirected plasticity neuroplasticity selfdirected meaning the only person that can change their brain for the better after about age 25 is the actual person you can't force neuroplasticity on somebody positive neuroplasticity so the other element that's really important to plasticity is this deep rest phase and it's associated with the release of the molecule neuromodulator serotonin serotonin is a reward molecule just like dopamine except that it's released in the brain in response to the subjective experience that we have enough resources so when we eat a big meal or we enjoy even better when we enjoy a meal with friends or family and it just feels like one of those incredible evenings you know you're reset it's that feeling of being reset it's as an antidepressive effect when we are um when you hold you know if you hold your child or or a partner that you love or your dog if you love your dog there's this feeling of having enough and so whereas dopamine is really the molecule that makes us look at things outside the boundaries of our skin like to be in pursuit of things this really is the pursuit motivation molecule serotonin is really about feeling like we have enough in our immediate environment and it's so powerful because unless that dope that excuse me that serotonin box is checked off periodically we cannot lean back into the dopamine outward pursuit process for very long so we need serotonin absolutely to feel more what complete whole safe safe once you feel this is where people you know i think that the gogetters get it wrong no pun intended where getting after it and being hard driving is really important but you know we've all seen examples this i've seen a number of these in silicon valley friends that did very well in tech get to the point where they reach that finish line and then they don't have a whole lot or a whole lot of people to share that with and they end up very isolated and depressed and they go through this whole cycle of trying to find themselves and um you need to balance serotonin and dopamine maybe across the day maybe across the week you know i think in religious practices all religions really there's a kind of sabbath there's a rest period you know for many many i think all of them um that makes sense because there needs to be a renewal whether or not people have a religious practice or not there needs to be a renewal or recovery a recovery to recover the immune system you can't drive the immune system all week all week all week you need to recover this is why i love sports analogies because there's uh a preseason there's a season there's a postseason where you're really in high stress and emotion and then there's a postseason there's an off season right for a reason you can't be in season 10 years yeah you know in a row you've got to find time to relax and have a bye week it's like if you don't have a bye week you're probably injured eventually so it's just like trying to create that in your own life do you do that for yourself as well do you have definitely i've got things i do each day and i've got things i do on a weekly basis i'm less good about the annual vacation i've never done it i've been doing science 25 years i i you know there's a i i'm sure uh some of my former relationships will be like that's right we never actually took a proper vacation yeah my former girlfriend i was like we'd go to like paris england and we would reach germany and i was giving talks and talks and then and then i'd get sick and then one day she was so understanding it's like i still feel some guilt about that but we would take an afternoon and go to a gallery but then i was like right back at it you know that's been my life too it's it's hard i mean you have to find that balance you know luckily i was in my 30s then and when you're in your 20s and 30s you can get away with less serotonin in your system but now you need more serotonin oh absolutely so what do you do every day to get more serotonin sleeping an adequate amount is key the the practice that served me the best has not been a meditative practice there are two practices one is called yoga nidra which is doesn't involve any movement you just it literally means yoga sleep this was introduced to me about five years ago just laying on your back you listen to a script there are a lot of scripts on youtube and it teaches you to there's some breathing involved but it's really a body scan you learn to go into deep relaxation i do this once or twice a day if i wake up and i haven't had enough sleep i do it first thing 510 minutes uh there's a 20minute script i like there is a 10minute script that's out there too i can give you the links to these if people are interested in them i have no affiliation with any uh yoga nidra businesses but i love what the practice because i feel like i recover the sleep i didn't get i then feel really alert in the afternoon if i'm feeling tired i'll do yoga ninja it also involves some intentions which has a kind of pseudo hi selfhypnosis component and i have a colleague david spiegel in the department of psychiatry who does clinical hypnosis and these intentions that we do in states of deep relaxation are known to have positive effects on thinking in action they are in pain mitigation and even breast cancer outcomes david's work has shown that so we're not saying stage hypnosis with like a pendant we're talking selfhypnosis selfhypnosis or medical hypnosis it's like you said deliberate thought as opposed to reactive thought right and you're in going you're teaching your body and brain to go into deep relaxation deliberately you're doing it and that's i think a power you're saying okay relax lay down relax your body relax your face calm you know breathe slower you're telling yourself to do it you're using the body to control the mind that's again and you're deliberately turning your thoughts off most people can't do that and so for me yoga nidra has been a absolute amplifier accelerator whatever you want to call it on my career in life and wellbeing it also gets you better at falling asleep because one of the reasons why people have trouble falling asleep is they can't turn their thoughts off so you're training your nervous system how to do this i should say because it sounds a little bit out there in the um kind of new ag space there are several studies imaging studies positron emission tomography studies and others looking at yoga ninja specifically this wasn't worked on by my lab although we are exploring it in my lab as a tool for stress mitigation anxiety mitigation but these studies show that 30 minutes i believe it was of yoganidra resets the levels of dopamine in an area of the brain called the basal ganglia which prepares the brain and body for action so these deep relaxation states even if we're wide awake still allow the nervous system to reset so that it can get back into action so for the gogetters if you're really if you want to have a long career you want to highperform your whole career you want to have tools that allow you to reset that dopamine level because that is accomplished that has a huge effect excuse me on buffering adrenaline as we said earlier but in addition to that serotonin is what resets the dopamine pathway so now there's sort of what we're seeing is kind of a logic to it you need to alt you need to alternate rest and effort you need to reward effort you need to understand with rest with rest so there's yoga nidra and i would say the best time to do is first thing in the morning before you go sleep at night or any time of day in other words i believe everyone should have some deep relaxation process that's deliberate that doesn't involve ingesting anything you know not food or wine for some people you know a drink is fine i'm i'm focused on behavioral tools you know supplements and drugs have their place in you know so they're clinically depressed people that need a boost in dopamine or need a boost in serotonin and i'm i think even though drugs like prozac get a bad rap those drugs have also saved millions of lives there's just an appropriate dose and context and some people shouldn't take them well people also what i'm hearing you say is you can should take them when you need them when you're unable to physically create those habits for yourself and routines for yourself but then once you take it you're always going to need it until you can learn how to behaviorally change your actions that's right right it's like the obese person that finally you know if they really can't move right you know maybe they do need to do some sort of surgical procedure or they need it or they need to do something that but then once they start exercising you you i believe you always want to go behaviors focus on behaviors first get the behaviors dialed in everything we've talked about today is free everything we talked about is is selfdirected so it's behaviors then i think it i think diet and is very important or nutrition i think supplementation definitely has its place i think we are past the the ridiculous idea of the 80s and 90s like oh can't you get everything from what you no one can even agree on what we're supposed to eat right every scientist i know who's serious about their mind and body takes supplements yeah i don't have a supplement company i'm very clear about this but they all have their regime for them and i think we're seeing a tide change now where supplements are no longer being thought of as this like niche thing that only bodybuilders and like people are selling snake oil are about there is a lot of snake oil out there but there are also some supplements that are powerful for the sorts of things that we're talking about for sleep and all the others we can talk about them if you like but i think it's behaviors nutrition supplements and then there is a place for prescription drugs there are people that are clinically depressed and suicidal and need help and they need to talk to a boardcertified md and get a hold of in some cases the opinion of whether or not they should take these drugs doesn't mean they should take them forever but you know we tend to jump to drugs and that's why i think a lot of those drugs they won't change your behaviors you still need to change your research the easy way out to start is taking the drugs but what you should be doing is the behavioral nutrition supplements if you do us three things first you should start to feel better oh absolutely yeah sunlight in the morning the things we've talked about breathing relaxing yeah all these things i have a friend he's a md and he says it says it beautifully he says you know better living through chemistry still requires better living right there is no pill or substance or psychedelic that's going to completely rewire you it's not even clear what that would look like and then there's a fifth category that's starting to emerge now which is brain machine interface things like devices that people put on and to adjust their brain waves enhance plasticity there are great devices out there for what i would say reading and measuring from the nervous system monitoring sleep for instance monitoring brain waves we're still in the infancy of good commercially available brain machine interface but i think that will eventually show up the the other thing because you asked about tools each day i have a daily practice of doing yoga nidra um for me that's my form of meditation and sort of serotonin reset the other one is gratitude i know gratitude gets a lot of discussion nowadays but i always want to point out that gratitude is it's not complacency people think it's navel gazing and it's but it has been shown to increase levels of serotonin in the brain it's a scienti now it's i did an interview with um dr lori santos she's the yale professor science of happiness at yale yeah i had her on and i was like okay what are the top scientific reasons for happiness right now that are proven and she was like gratitude is like one of the top three or four it's like okay so this is not woowoo anymore she's like no this is scientifically proven that gratitude makes you happier i think gratitude is wonderful it resets the system so that you can be in pursuit i think gratitude sounds like complacency and people like oh i don't want to be a naval gazer i'm just then i'm not going to be content then i'm home excuse me then people fear that they're not going to be complacent they're like i'm just happy with where i'm at but serotonin resets dopamine which puts you back in the fight and allows you to fight longer and further and i guess i'm doing this a lot today but i've had the great um you know privilege of doing some work with these communities if you look at high performers in these very high risk high consequence special operations communities they have gratitude practices really they do then they incorporate them and so you know people think there's like some secret sauce or there's something you know and they are very unique individuals and very special individuals but they but they have those practices they're the same tools that andrew can use that's right we all have these tools you do yoga nidra you do gratitude practice throughout the day what else do you do so the first thing i do when i wake up in the morning is i actually is a gratitude no matter what pops in my head i reorient to being grateful that i'm waking up i mean you know it's uh you know i've had a number of close calls in life i've lost people like everybody i'm 45 so you know seen a lot of babies born seeing a lot of people die that's just the way it goes but just i express some gratitude for just waking up yes and that puts me in forward motion and then i can do things like make my bed reward that that i'm not doing something else that you know and start getting into things and i tend to reward uh relationships in a big way my dog's 10 years old i raised him since he was a puppy he's getting he's a bulldog he's probably getting to the end i try and really just focus on the sheer pleasure of having a bulldog there are such characters and him in particular relationships of all kinds like if i spend time with people or just i just try and think about mentors people that got me where i where i am i do that all the time and i'm pretty as you probably imagine i talk fast i work a lot i'm pretty intense but i finish my days now not feeling ground out and depleted doesn't mean i'm grateful for every opportunity or everything that comes my way i have to be conscious of it but i think a deliberate practice that of relishing or enjoying what we have is so powerful and not just going through the motions if we're not enjoying it and we're just waiting for the end result we're going to be unhappy absolutely and there's something called dopamine reward prediction error where people work work work work work or they expect something to be great and as you do that you actually raise the level of dopamine that's required to make it feel good when you get there this is why people you know achieve great things and kill themselves it's crazy you know the failure to respect these neurochemical pathways in these neural pathways the is actually i mean it it's basically throwing away everything that we were given in my opinion and i don't want to give the impression that people have to follow these protocols because i'm talking about them we were all given these you know people will sometimes ask me they'll say you know is there an app or a product around this i just say look mother nature has the patent for this you know whatever people's beliefs you know this stuff was built into us for whatever reason and we can use these different neurochemical pathways to organize our life in a way that really serves us and the people around us best and the gratitude practice can be one second long it can be 10 minutes if you want people do love and kindness meditation i've never done that i've always had a hard time being in meditation for a long period of time i'm not good at mental visualization yeah um so i tend to gear more towards behaviors when you're you're a neuroscientist you're not good at mental visualization well i you know i try but i think some we all differ in our ability to um hold on to a mental imagery and mine's kind of fleeting so i tend to write things out but yeah gratitude practices i get try and get sun in my eyes i mean exercise i love i'm fortunate that i love exercise and training i think that got into me young um for people that that's harder to do then you know you just build these things up through subjective rewards yeah yeah i want to go back to um neuroplasticity at a later age in life how much like let's say i want to every year i want to challenge myself to learn something that's harder or maybe not it comes easy to me maybe it's spanish this next couple years and then something else 10 years the older i get say 80 90 100 hopefully i get there if i keep pushing my mind to be challenged in that way that's uncomfortable will that actually help me to live longer or will it hurt me to living a shorter life oh that's a great question i hear people like who live in the blue zones around the world right who they kind of have their normal routine they have their family they walk up a hill every day they eat a certain way and they have good community relationships but they're i don't know if i've heard them say like they're constantly challenging their mind to expand i pretty confident saying that it's not going to shorten your life remember that the dopamine system and so dopamine and acetylcholine are the primary triggers for adult neuroplasticity we know this because if you there are experiments done by a guy named mike marzinick at ucsf if you stimulate the areas of the brain that release dopamine and acetylcholine you can rapidly induce plasticity like one trial learning like spanish today right like fluent in spanish today which is kind of scary this is actually the basis of companies that are thinking about inserting wires into the brain and stimulating i could be fluent in spanish today in theory if you stimulate enough acetylcholine and dopamine release while experiencing enough spanish you probably have to speak that spanish you probably have to read it wow you could remember it and connect it yeah it's it's possible it's like matrix it's possible i know kung fu yeah we're not quite there yet but it's possible it's been done in in other forms of learning in other studies really yeah what's it called well if you release that well you'd have to actually have an electrode down in your head i don't know that you want to drill a point put something in your hand you'd have to drill through enough dopamine in your you would remember the dopamine comes from the neurons that are in there so you'd be stimulating the dopamine neurons acetylcholine neurons and you'd be probably reading a spanish script there are i i will say there are yeah well there are programs happening right now to accelerate language learning through implantable electrodes no way it's already happening it's happening someone's done it before it's happening now they're testing it i don't think they're at one day for an entire for fluency but they are definitely at massively accelerated language learning really yeah i have close friends that do this sort of no one for a living you know someone who's done this who run the laboratories who do this kind of thing absolutely so what do they do they put something in your head well the goal so we we know that dopamine acetylcholine from experimental already published results if those are released then in massive amounts whatever you pair that release with whatever sensory experience massively rewires the brain wow according to that experience so merzenik has these beautiful studies where he showed that if you play a certain auditory tones and you stimulate these brain areas the auditory cortex the area of the brain that listens and hears and understands sounds massively rewires according to what was played in that moment but because these neurochemicals are like gates they open the gate to plasticity you normally engage them by focus agitation stress and strain selfreward etc or going to you know and having a conversation in spanish we're like wow i'm i'm doing it i'm fluent i'm doing it that's going to keep it i'd get it right but you can imagine there are um groups on this planet that are very interested in rapidly accelerated language learning that would be willing to put many millions or billions of dollars probably not billions toward programs to get massively accelerated language learning by putting either implantable chips in the brain that will stimulate these brain areas including memory areas or stimulating acetylcholine or dopamine so people have already done this where they put a cut open their head and put a chip in their brain these are neurosurgery patients who are already undergoing surgery for other reasons and have agreed that you want to try this yeah really yeah and there are animal studies doing this all the time shut up absolutely and are there any results of this well they're not the groups that are doing these sorts of things are not going to reveal the results just yet so you can imagine that these are related to you know these are government military type contracts it makes sense right you'd want to do this um yeah absolutely and it's definitely happening overseas too i mean massively accelerated learning is kind of the holy grail of neuroscience right right how can we learn anything faster right because time is the thing that we're all trying to maximize right and you know and you could imagine that because the human brain can in development can be biased toward becoming exceptional at math or exceptional athletics i mean you could build brains that are you could bias brains to be very very good even exceptional at the level of surpassing all previous behavior by triggering these sorts of plasticity events yeah i mean i wouldn't run out and put the chip in your head immediately i mean this stuff has to be worked out but there are certainly there's a whole community that's spinning up right now around nootropics smart drugs right it's not a it's not a word or an area that i'm really a big fan of because like what are you talking about creativity task implementation focus like the word smart drugs is terrible new tropics is even worse because it's not pointed enough it's not it doesn't it doesn't illustrate exactly what the end goal is it's sort of a throwaway catchall kind of like smart drug like what is smart right so but there are you know for instance i know a um nobel prizewinning neuroscientist who chews immense amounts of nicaragua each day he's in the 70s because it increases his focus he quit smoking which stimulates nicotine and those stimulate acetylcholine so nicaragua is a nicotinic stimulant and nicotine is acetylcholine receptor so his goal is to continue to learn in his old age by stimulating the nicotine pathway certainly yeah he chooses nonstop nicotine now i'm not recommending people chew nicaragua i want to be clear i'm not a doctor i'm not prescribing anything i'm professors i'm professing things but the the there are things like um choline alpha gpc that will stimulate acetylcholine release and will allow you in theory to learn quicker and better in about of learning so something to give you more focus yeah under adversity they'll so they will trigger the plasticity event to be you know it's like driving like carving that knife in deeper but then you need a corresponding increase in the amount of rest in order to make sure that those pathways get better think about it like going to the gym i actually have seen these guys in the gym in la where they've got electrodes on the muscles so they're maximally recruiting motor units but then you need that much more recovery because it's not unusual to get those high threshold motor units you need to rest for two days you can't go back to the gym tomorrow right and a lot of these guys are also drug assisted to the point where you can almost smell it from across the room right but um that's another story yeah but but that whole area is geared around maximum stimulus maximum recovery maximum stimulus maximum recovery so drugs supplements can accelerate these processes a fun one from sports because it should have been the olympics this year but you know the sprinters have their own drug community it's not just the anabolics they those sprints are won by who gets out the blocks fastest that's reaction time and there's a there's lore i'm not involved in this but there's lore of sprinters taking drugs to accelerate nerve transmission by focusing on the the on the gun it's all about hearing the gun and getting out the blocks so they take drugs to stimulate dopamine and acetylcholine because that's what you have a faster reaction more focus faster reactions so is that activating the adrenaline receptor adrenal receptors so you react quicker it's actually happening at the neural level and it's it they're it's allowing them to hear the gun as it's going off and not hear it after the fact that's right because you can lose by being the last person out the block most of those drugs are illegal but there's a whole there's a whole world of drugs in sports that are geared around the mental side and focus and the ability to get into sleep i mean you can bet given now the the understanding that sleep is so fundamentally important for performance people are hacking sleep like crazy chilly blankets magnesium you know theanine certain things that i think do work you know people are wearing whoops and the aura rings and it's all about sleep now right it's all about sleep susie because it's so powerful and they're the ultimate drug and people are now developing drugs that will allow people to fall asleep and sleep better get function better on less sleep optimize the amount of slow wave sleep time anyway it's a whole whole world i'm fascinated by it because it's the extreme of the things that we're talking about but for the typical person behaviors are the way to go behaviors and nutrition is not an area of my expertise but incidentally you know the body is connected to the mind the body's connected to the mind and if the body doesn't have good gut health and good nutrients then it's going to be affecting the way you think and the way you feel and the way you act absolutely it's going to be harder and harder if you don't have energy right and food and nutrition gives you proper energy that's right or it takes the energy away from you that's right depletes you from energy so so the older we get it's harder to expand our neuroplasticity but that's why we should be learning new challenging things every year is what i'm hearing you say right help us yeah and whether or not it extends the lifespan i don't know but i do know this so the dopamine pathway is intimately tied to the reproductive hormone pathway so testosterone and dopamine have a very close relationship so much so that they're released and they're triggering their releases from very neighboring areas in the brain because if you think about it it's the pursuit molecule right like testosterone's main effect is to make stress and effort feel good that's what it does it suppresses that kind of grinding response that gets painful and increases recovery in women which are more estrogen dominant the testosterone dominant and both men and women both have testosterone estrogen of course estrogen is sort of similar to testosterone in that it's coupled to dopamine a lot of people think the opposite of testosterone is estrogen it's not it's it's a molecule called prolactin prolactin is what's secreted after orgasm it's what secreted after a big win and there's that crash it's designed to keep organisms in the place they are so that there's pair bonding there's recovery and shift them into that serotonin machine so the reason i mention this is that being in pursuit of goals and trying to trigger neuroplasticity isn't just about changing your brain it's closely linked to the reproductive hormones testosterone in men and estrogen in women meaning it's linked to the will to live the will to to pursue and it's not just about sex i know as soon as we talk about testosterone and estrogen people start people think about mating behavior it's that but there's a lot more it's the will to live so when dopamine is reduced the will to live is reduced when serotonin is too high and dopamine is too low people feel like they have everything they need think chronic pot smokers no no beef against the pot smokers but they don't tend to be the most ambitious people sometimes they are but they tend to make people pretty placid i think um you know any high levels of antidepressants that make you feel like you have enough of everything you need they make people kind of there's a passivity there so that's why it's important to keep these things in the right range so the will to live is tied to the dopamine system and to the reproductive system so what do we do what are we doing when we when we don't have a goal in our life what happens to us we are essentially on idle doesn't mean that we don't have the will to live it means that we are idling and the brain and body because they are so intimately related with one another and affect one another they see when we're in pursuit of a goal and that sends every organ in the body the message to keep going that you know the will to live is getting out of kind of a deeper abstract concept but it's a real thing and so people that are low in estrogen and typically in women or in men people are low in testosterone or people are or low in dopamine so it's ultimately dopamine which is motivation and drive in pursuit you don't want too high but you definitely don't want it too low and we need in order to increase our dopamine we do some of these tools right you want to be in pursuit of something you want friction but you also want to be able to reward the effort process reward that friction process now keep in mind children which have the ultimate will to live you know in positive environments children are wonderful because they're all about the will to explore and live and learn that it's just their their default is to explore live and learn yeah yeah and children are flooded with dopamine you show them a baby something new and it's like because it's the mother nature has wired them to use that process to incorporate new ideas and new learnings that's how they can learn that's how they learn the more you know what they have they can learn they connect ideas and they can grow they and they play i mean you tell kids a story a ridiculous story and they'll go with you on that as we become set in our ways it's kind of interesting the brain over time the space between the neurons tends to fill in with this stuff called extracellular matrix it's like pouring concrete between the neurons makes it much harder for them to rearrange and move around but a lot of beautiful studies experimental studies have shown that that extracellular matrix if it can be reduced the neurons can move around and form new connections and the way to do that is by triggering some strong pursuit goal the more important the goal is the more the faster the plasticity is going to happen how does someone like you i don't want a stereotype a scientist and a professor but how does someone like you have fun when most scientists are more like lab rats that are just like focused on the research and the work and getting it done how do you incorporate play and fun in your life well i love doing science because to me being a brain explorer is like the coolest thing i mean when i was a little kid i want to be an astronaut and then i didn't pursue that path and but for me the next best thing is to be a brain explorer and you know dig around in the brain and try and understand the brain and um but i enjoy let's see i i'm a little bit of a sicko in the sense that i love music i love food i love to eat i love to train i love friendship yeah i i'm at this point now and i wasn't always like this i've definitely experienced depression i've been there i i'm at the point now where maybe it's the gratitude practice maybe it's the fact that i'm trying to get enough sleep and i sometimes do but i'm i just feel so happy to be in relation to all these opportunities and the fact that people care about neuroscience and they want to learn and that there's a place for me in this world to teach it you know it's just kind of like an endless source of joy i love movies music friendship training food dog my dog um goodness uh art i you know i i think i've found enough things in the world that i love that um you know i feel like i have like five times five lifetimes worth of things to pursue what about fears do you have a lot of fears and how much does fear play into to the body of my connection well the fear is huge in the bodymind connection because it can shut us down i mean fear can really take us to the point of you know from a place of feeling really great to just they can like crump us all at once and i mean the things that um well i have several fears one is you know i had this weird um history in science where my undergraduate advisor my graduate advisor my postdoc advisor are all dead they all died young so it's like it was suicide cancer cancer was really rough because i was close with all of them and so i have one major fear which is dying without getting the information that i believe should be out in the world out into the world because i'm struck by this all the time you know when people die there's no download from their brain there's no fossil record of their thoughts unless they write they speak they put things out into the world for some people it's art for other people it's their family whatever it is but one fear is that uh you know i'll get hit by a bus or something or have a heart attack before i'm able to express you know sort of put out my expression that's one and then the other is you know these days i have a lot of irons in the fire doing public education running my lab my lab's actually two labs um i guess a big fear of mine is that you know in trying to take on so many things that the quality will drop and so as a consequence i've had to really put boxes around my life so that i can really dig in and i'm blessed to have amazing people in my lab i mean i've just my lab operations manager i would die without him like you know my graduate students in post docs you know they're phenomenal and so i'm blessed to have great people around me but yeah i would say that's one of the big fears is that um you know that i can't do it all yeah and of course i can't but but i have not tried to learn spanish fluently do you want to or no i do actually a few years ago i i promised on social media i was going to learn spanish as proof of principle for neuroplasticity and that i would deliver some of the tutorials in spanish because there's huge parts of the world that i think are curious about neuroscience they don't have access to them and i i abandoned mission temporarily tell you what man i've been saying this for 20 years i want to learn spanish and foreign i have a spanish girlfriend now from from mexico which gives me more of a a motivation which i know you talked about needing some greater motivation it'll accelerate the process if you have like a reason why that's supposed to just i want to do this because you're going to quit probably unless there's a bigger reason a bigger reward at the end and i've been saying this since you know high school i took spanish in high school college i've traveled all over latin america spain everything i'm a passionate salsa dancer for 15 years been dancing extreme amounts of guys like you have bumped me out a number of times because because once salsa picks up their salsa dancing i'm like uh like the door like perfect exactly yeah and i that was another thing that i was committed to learning because it was so challenging to learn that i was like i need to go all in i need to create like reward loops for myself all this stuff because it was so embarrassing and humiliating to get started in something in a completely uncomfortable setting but now you're very skilled at it now i can go anywhere in the world any salsa club and find the best dancer and dance with them in a moment without speaking to them and feel 100 that's admirable it's the greatest feeling and i want that in every other area of my life i want it in spanish because i want this message to reach 100 million people a week and i know the latin community could use this message so your incentive was the same and like information transfer exactly and i'm also like okay you can translate things you could have a translator with you you have subtitles but my dad's from a latin country is from argentina and um when people make the effort to respect it well it's it's just it's such a deep sign of respect to really go over to somebody else's side and deliver it in a form that's really designed for them yeah that's a it's almost like you have empathy for someone else when you try to learn something that they know and that's hard for you to learn so i said to myself okay i've tried to do this many times the last 20 years and i've always failed i was like i need to pay for it i need to do it every week i need to have a oneonone teacher because i've tried apps i've tried this stuff all these things didn't work and i need to stop thinking about becoming fluent right i need to start appreciating the process of every day just doing it right and after six months i'll be able to see and look back like okay i actually know some stuff then after a year or two i'll know a little more and then hopefully one day i'm just fluent and attach reward to the intention and the effort process yes i mean what i heard you say was that it at a very core level you really want to meet people where they're at so that they can derive more from the message absolutely and so if you can build so as an example of the the subjective reward process the more that you can tap into that intention this is why i think intentions and um being able to be pulled by some bigger greater greater mission is is the ultimate thing because then the discomfort we feel is offset by this reward that you can always look to yes it's like it's always there it's it's like having that magic drug on the shelf that you can just take but yeah because it's internal it's always with you which is far more powerful than needing it from some external source exactly exactly so i'm excited so i'm excited i'm excited for this the spanish speaking people out there they're gonna hear something so not to hold your feet to the fire no but i feel like um it's just i gotta enjoy the process and i gotta enjoy like the challenges of day to day and i'm starting to make it fun now i'm starting to when i'm like really stressed because i'll get tired when i'm just like i have no clue what this means and all i want to do is like go watch sports or go work out but the confusion is the trigger that's what i'm learning from it's saying it's like raising a flag and it's saying there's something special about this mental track that we need to return to later and it's flagging it yes and so when you sleep where you're doing something else you'll reconnect you're actually yeah that's that's so that's what i'm doing learning when i'm getting frustrated and challenged now i'm just like i just start having fun i'm just like okay fantastic i'm just like being playful in the moment and it brings me with more energy as opposed to like this lazy tired feeling i'm like excited i'm like okay i don't know this but i'm gonna figure it out one day so good and uh and so it's just like i'm committing to the process and making the the process the prize not the end result the price right and also maybe someday you'll run for office and then you can you know you can reach more people with a specific message i think it's like what 60 million uh spanishspeaking people in america 40 million or something like that there's a lot of people so who knows anyways um my team's telling me i need to wrap this up because i want to go into talking a lot about fear and how to overcome fear and eliminating stress and all these different things um but they'll have to get you back on and talk about these things so hopefully you'll come back on and i'll be i'd be happy to come back any time we'll do more and talk about fear and how to overcome fear and all these different things but this has been fascinating and i want to ask you a couple final questions andrew one is um call the three truths so imagine it's your last day on earth and uh you've you've actually accomplished all of your you've gotten all your work out there in the world that you wanted to create okay your books your lab results all the research you got to do 99 of it right okay you're always going to want to do more but you got to do as much as you could yeah you have books out there lectures everything is out in the world that you wanted to do but it's your last day and you've got a for whatever reason you've got to take all of your work with you so this podcast is gone your books your results everything so it's all gone with you to the next place wherever you go but you got a pen and a piece of paper and you get to write down three things you know to be true about your entire life and the lessons you've learned that you would share with the world this is all we have to remember you by or your lessons i call it the three truths okay what would you say are your three truths okay well the first one i'm gonna poach from the oracle which is know thyself i do believe that through whatever exploration whether or not it's therapy meditation religious uh exercise all of the above i think people should um explore what they're you know sort of how they're showing up in the world yeah and then obviously based on today's discussion i believe that we can make changes around that but know thyself wish i had said it but someone beat me to the punch the second one is um it's rather freudian but um i do think there's a core set of operations about the way we work um that are important is you can imagine three boxes it's like a three box diagram and in the first one it would say wish then there's an arrow next to it it would say anxiety and then there'd be an arrow and then the last one would say defense typically we have a wish it creates some anxiety in us and then we get into some reflexive defensive behavior for some people that's addiction for some people that's you know rabid ambition to the point of neglecting things whatever the defense is and i think our job is to intervene between anxiety and defense or at least come up with defenses that serve humanity so that we're giving as opposed to destroying right but i do think that wish anxiety defense is a big one and then goodness and then for the last one a couple days ago i might not have said this but i had an experience that leads me to say i think um you know have fun yeah because it's the ultimate reset it's not the only thing you want to do but it's really tragic when people are so hard driving that they can't derive pleasure and as we you know talked about today the pleasure process is part of the renewal process as part of the the ability to be in greater pursuit yeah you know and i think that when we're having fun you know provided it's not at somebody else's expense i think that it has a regenerative quality to it and that we can um yeah i think that's the best experience of life it's hard to learn and grow without having fun is what i've heard hearing you say yeah i actually i stole this i feel bad because i stole it later i i uh the great pleasure of knowing you know the laird hamilton great hamilton and we've done some training and we were talking about and i was we were leaving uh their house and he said um what laird said he said you know remember i'm gonna get this wrong laird so sorry but um he said something like remember in fear of death have fun yeah and he he was not saying go and do stupid things that put you in in risk what he was saying was you know this fear of death is something we all live with and we all struggle with so we have to remember to have fun that's it or something like that i think i i botched it but i was saying you know um you know larry's done some incredible things in his life he's incredible human being and family man and husband and father all this stuff and friend and so i was like you know i could afford to have more fun so that's what i'm telling myself these days yeah the scientists got to have fun too yeah i'm trying where can we follow you on on social media and how can we support you in this moment you got a book coming out in the future but future i know i haven't gotten around to actually writing the whole thing um i teach neuroscience and do regular neuroscience posts on instagram yeah they're fascinating by the way what's your what's your handle there it's huberman lab so hubermanlab okay and uh right now i'm doing a hundred days of neuroscience in the 15second reels format yeah which is a real challenge to me but i do some longer posts we talk about everything from stress fear dopamine learning we touch on some stuff related to like autism alzheimer's things like that it's not medical advice but i talk about the research i invite researchers on to talk about their work and it's a lot of fun and there's a lot of the questions there so people can send me questions cool so follow you on instagram twitter as well hubermann lab and you you reply to people there i do yeah mainly instagram i do have a twitter account but mainly instagram okay cool awesome this is fascinating man i can't wait to have you back on in the future and i want to acknowledge you andrew for the incredible gift that you have to educate us about understanding thoughts feelings emotions all this stuff i think it's so confusing especially in 2020 on how to improve our lives when there's so much destruction and distraction and noise and stress and anxiety like we've talked about so for you to come and bring a scientific practical and then make it practical as well how we can apply this in our life it's really empowering to so many people so i acknowledge you for oh thank you gift you are man for constantly showing up this is really beautiful thank you thanks for having me on it's been a real pleasure i was a fan long before you invited me on so for me it's especially gratifying we'll have you back on a bunch man i'm excited and my final question what's your definition of greatness the human species was given this tremendous gift of neuroplasticity the ability to change ourselves and be better in deliberate ways and my definition of greatness is anyone that's making that effort even in a tiny way just to take this incredible machinery that we were given this nervous system and to leverage it toward being better feeling better and showing up better for other people that's i really believe that's why we're here yeah amen thank you very much thank you appreciate it man and if you want to learn more about how to master your mind check out this next video right here 25 of our blood flow goes into this thinking brain and the rest is like on stand by do you think it's possible yeah do you think it's

60 may seem like a bit of a review and in some ways it is but these reviews i think are important to get everybody kind of together as in terms of where we at least on this podcast stand in terms of all things contrarian investing because i've been spending a lot of time on crypto lately and we will talk about crypto in this episode as well but we'll also talk about all the other things we do because i haven't spoken on that in a while now the big news recently has been the rise in the stock market and the crypto market and the 75 basis point uh rate increase for the united states dollar that happened this week now this was expected to happen but even though it was expected to happen everything still went nuts which to me does not make a lot of sense now i did an entire blog post on this on thursday if you missed it i will put that down below in the show notes as well and the blog post goes over the two scenarios that are most likely to happen either the fed does pivot and starts lowering rates and probably printing money again or do they just power through and continue to raise rates until inflation goes down and what will the markets likely do if those two situations occur so a pretty important blog post i think make sure you read that but beyond all of this let's go ahead and talk about some of the markets we trade and where i think they're at let's start with precious metals now the last i really talked about this is when i actually bought physical gold but i usually buy physical gold irrespective of price i mean i like to buy it when it's on a dip but physical gold at the end of the day is just insurance on my money nothing more if i'm playing it offensively then i do that in the form of gold mining stocks now what's up with the mining sector well we really don't know a lot of people in the sector and in the precious metal space are saying that we have hit bottom back when gold was at 1700 and silver was approaching 18 now they could be right but if you have listened to people in the precious metal space for any amount of time they are wrong so often with this stuff that you just don't even pay them a lot of attention anymore and on top of that a lot of this stuff doesn't even fall in line with what the stock market does one way or the other you know it doesn't correlate it doesn't uncorrelate sometimes it does sometimes it doesn't you know my whole thing this entire time with precious metals and in particular precious metals mining stocks has always been just to be right and sit tight you know take the pain because the upside is absolutely worth it and that's what i will continue to do you know i already have a lot of positions i'm not really looking to add on many more there is one in particular and that might become a watchlist video in the future you know not everything on my watch list is crypto believe it or not so stay tuned if i feel like there's an appropriate time and place for that i will certainly make an episode and bring it to you but that's really all you have to know as far as precious metals investing goes right now i'm just happy that the trading is very good and we will let the investing chips fall wherever they lay now over to base metals and my whole thing with basemail is the reason why you almost never hear me talk about it unless it's copper is i just feel and you guys know i'm a bit of a doomsdayer if you follow me here or you follow me on twitter i fall more to that side of the spectrum you know i'm not all the way on that end but i do feel like we're going to approach a time and we're already getting there contrarians where we just stop building as a planet because for once in a very long time we have other things that are simply more important and especially if we have an energy crisis and a food crisis which i anticipate both of those things occurring fairly soon you know how much sense would it make to continue to build factories and homes and new roads and things like that when people are freezing and starving you know not a good idea if you want to get elected you know i feel like the world is going to pull inward and just kind of keep what we have and if growth suffers growth suffers but the the main goal is going to be simply surviving you know as people but as corporations too you know you build and you expand when you can you know when everything else is fine which for a long time it was but what's going to happen when it's not anymore and i think china is going to be one of the first ones in here we're already seeing things fall apart over there as much as they don't want us to know and they're the ones who have been gobbling up all these base metals and all these commodities you know they have already slowed down and despite what you see in the news sometimes i think they're going to have no choice but to slow down much more even come to an overall stop you know so this does not serve well for things like iron ore for things like lumber for things like zinc so you know we are buy and hold longterm investors here on the podcast so that's why i really at no point in time at any episode of the podcast have i mentioned it because i just felt like there was going to be a time where the world stops building and it looks like we're getting there you know if you have an energy crisis in your country it's going to be very hard to build anything now the costs are going to be so high it's not going to make sense anymore now notice i have left out copper in this whole equation and it's because i'm still bullish on copper because i just think we're going to get a total wipeout in supply and if you remember my copper video we need it for not only the new technology but all the old technology too and when it comes to all of this if i am wrong i still want to have exposure here because we are probably going into a commodity super cycle sooner than later and i am continuing to hold on to all of my copper stocks because i think at the very least that's the one that's going to take off before the rest do so now on to the stock market and in that blog where i talked about the fed raising rates the main conclusion i really come to and i didn't state this conclusion in the blog but i think no matter what they do the market's still going down you know as i've mentioned so many times before we still have the six crises that have not happened yet fully although a number of them are in their early stages now and now with the fed pivots there should be a rally but i feel like that rally is going to be shortlived i do not think the fed has the full power and the full faith in the market that they used to you know if there's one thing they have shown the world in the last probably four or five months is that they really do not know what they're doing years ago they could just wave their little magic wand and everything would work out in their favor but now it's not economics is finally winning oh and by the way no matter what the administration says we are officially in a recession you know as much as we try to stay apolitical here on the show this administration i swear to god they have just changed the words of everything because they think you're super stupid and maybe you simply won't notice and to a degree they're not wrong a lot of people just don't notice these things you know but we don't really worry about that because those people are the ones that are going to be the groups of people that have real problems financially down the road and that is not going to be us so at the end of the day it's really nothing to get too upset over we know what's really going on and we are in a recession and again again the energy crisis has not fully taken shape once that happens uh let's just say that is not bullish for the economy people are going to stop buying things people are going to stop traveling businesses are not going to be building none of this is good for the stock market and if you look at a chart you can see we have a long way to go down i think to assume that we have hit bottom is nuts you know the only thing that saved us last time is the fed just printing so much money trillions and trillions of dollars to the point where the market just couldn't take it anymore and it had to go back up you know that's the only reason why we didn't completely collapse back in 2020 the only reason you know the actual market in the actual economy had nothing to do with it and then in turn for the last two years things were able to get even more and more and more overvalued but it's a different story now isn't it printing money actually has consequences consequences that deeply concern voters and there is no longer any little creative ways to get yourself out of this so over time despite what you see and despite how long it lasts i really do think everything is going to go down much harder and probably take everything else with it you know at least at first and because that's what history has taught us and so whether it happens or not i still want you to be ready for that you know every time one of the markets falls sharply somebody says hey man i'm losing a lot of money on these positions can you make a podcast on this you know first off no i don't take requests second i must have said this a hundred times you know these drops are to be expected you know this is what we're waiting for this is what we are positioning ourselves for so to flip out when it happens and to run to me for answers just goes to show that you are not doing this the right way and you are probably investing money you can't really afford to lose which definitely means you're not ready for this so that is my overall grim outlook for the stock markets of the world now this is not just the american market this is all markets yeah continue to trade those indices if that's what you're doing i think there's going to be some really good opportunity on the long and short side now ending it off with crypto this week was so weird once the rate hike actually happened now keep in mind there was a small chance it was going to be 100 basis points but it wasn't it was exactly what it was scheduled to be so for markets to skyrocket the way it did was already very suspect behavior but to have it happen in the crypto market too was even more suspect so let's take quantum you guys remember this one ticker symbol qtum it's number 94 on coin gecko as we speak and it went up 647 in the last seven days so you mean to tell me that all of those quantum traders all of those quantum investors were paying so close attention to the rate decision and piled into quantum once the decision came out the decision by the way that was actually supposed to happen it's like really like does any of this make any sense now as we learned from the very top of the bull market there can be a million things out there that don't make any sense at all but can still just keep pumping but far more often than not the end result from all this is very very ugly ugly to the downside so i maintain the same approach i've been telling you about for the last few episodes i still look at my charts if my charts tell me to go i go but i go small and i go with the full expectation of being able to dollar cost average down should things drop further you know as i've said a couple times on this episode as i said many times on this show i could be wrong and i also position myself for that too this is really i'm telling you i think this is so underrated because i i think too many investors especially inexperienced investors especially investors with really big egos now we all have egos but simply the fact that i am investing for me possibly being wrong i think takes me out of that upper tier that upper tier of egoness i think most investors get so married to one ideology and then they only invest that way and if they're right great but the markets really do have a way of punishing people like this and they usually don't come out the other side but when it comes to investing there is a way to have your cake and eat it too and we try to do that here on the 10 minute contrarian podcast and in a perfect situation the crypto market tanks even further like like smashing way far beyond the lows we've already seen this year and then we come in like superheroes and scoop up everything near the bottom but if it doesn't work that way not only do we already have our existing positions but we have a plan a plan to still possibly buy during times like this because in the annals of history this is going to seem like a very good time to buy you know we are still in a bear market and prices are still relatively very low and you could do a lot worse so hold the line out there contrarians there are so many fireworks yet to go off this year and when the world is trying to get us to buy during a bear market during a recession there's probably reasons for that and as it often does i think patience is going to win the game you know it can get lonely out here on contrarian island doing things the way we do them but just remember at the end of the day at the end of the cycle at the end of the madness that we are not crazy we are just early", "hey everybody welcome to the podcast my guest today is dr andrew huberman andrew is a neuroscientist he's a neurobiology professor at stanford medical school and mcknight foundation and pew foundation fellow and the founder of huberman lab where he's involved in all kinds of really amazing breakthrough research on brain function brain plasticity and brain regeneration his work has been published in top journals like nature he's been featured in publications like time scientific america and the bbc and he's here today to discuss the brain to discuss growth mindset how to focus how to navigate the stressful times and many other subjects it's an incredible conversation i think you guys are gonna enjoy it i appreciate you watching make sure to hit that subscribe button and without further ado this is me and dr andrew huberman first of all thanks for doing this i appreciate you coming out yeah my pleasure long time coming i'm glad we're doing it in person likewise and not remotely and i think what i wanna do is start with your origin story because you're a very it's your path is very unlikely your path to becoming a scientist and i think it actually also kind of contextualizes some of the things that i wanna talk about with you today so maybe start there sure so on the one hand you know maybe i was faded to become a scientist i guess the two things that are relevant there are i always loved animals and i've always been obsessed with animal behavior like just could watch cousteau shows growing up you know underwater life or animals hunting animals doing anything it's just so fascinating to me because i'm i think even at a really young age i've always just been intrigued in sort of what drives different animals to behave in the way they do and how body form matches to i didn't know what it was but brains and how that all works so i've always been obsessed with animals and then my dad's a scientist so he's a physicist it was really early in chaos theory and so growing up in our home you know we had scientists over for dinner and graduate students would come over for barbecues and things like that is he a stanford professor yeah he was at stanford he was mostly at xerox park which is kind of famous if you read the steve jobs book is for the yeah the development of the gooey interface the graphical user interface and sort of early days of the computer so he had a lab there and he had a lab in applied physics at stanford and something called symbolic systems which is a stanford degree in kind of ecology and computation that kind of thing so i grew up in this family where science was very prominent and we had lots of discussions in our home that i would overhear and i didn't understand about physics and we'd spend summers at the aspen center for physics which was like good times yeah so you know and we were and to be clear you know you hear the word aspen you know we were a middleclass family but they have this aspen center for physics so the feynman you know richard feynman was there murray gellmann like all these luminaries of physics peter carruthers and my dad was really good at telling me the stories about these guys and then i'd always wanna meet them and it was mostly guys back then there weren't many women in physics so i you know i was kind of immersed in science from a young age but right about age 13 my parents split up and he moved overseas he moved to denmark and my mom was really struggling with the breakup and i wasn't in contact with him anymore so i had this really unusual childhood where you know we didn't talk about sports we talked about science and i had this close relationship with science and the people around science but then all of a sudden the structure around family like instead of dinners together every night it was just like me and my mom and i was an adolescent i was hitting puberty so you know there was bound to be some shifts in my world landscape and internal landscape anyway but basically what happened was i stopped really paying attention to school and i got really heavily into skateboarding and the kind of punk rock music and i found my pack or my community through like packing community of kids that also just were kind of parentless so this was like late 80s early 90s and so at a pretty young age i started taking the i grew up in palo alto i was actually born at stanford hospital i started taking the seven f bus up to san francisco and hanging around in embarcadero for the skateboarders out there the lizards this is the the now famous emb crowd so this was the birth of a huge movement of skateboarders that became professionals like so you'd see the young danny way would come through town and you had rob dyrdek i remember when he came through so all these names that eventually became popular during the kind of x games era and the but at that time it was really underground and so it was this pack of maybe a hundred guys and it was run like a little city and it was chaos it was like there was fights and there was drinking and there was lawlessness there was also a lot of amazing skateboarding and there were a lot of amazing people and there were some older guys like one in particular a very famous skateboarder is this kid mike carroll his older brother was kind of like the older brother to everybody kind of kept us all in check so it had its own unique organization and it's actually interesting 'cause the same thing was happening at that time in washington square park in new york and at love park in philadelphia there were all these like communities of kids that were basically parentless and so in that time i saw some interesting things first of all i learned what it was to be parentless growing up in palo alto it was like soccer games and ayso and you know swim club and all of a sudden i realized you know i don't have to be home at any particular time or you know none of these kids are going to school and so we all it was kind of a big group of truants and it was interesting because it gave me a perspective that i had never had in palo alto and i was drifting further and further away from any kind of academic rigor i think i would go to school every once in a while what's mom doing does she have any idea that you're going up to the city every day so she was totally checked out you know i think she was just devastated by a bunch of things that were happening and she lapsed into a pretty serious depression and then in that community what was interesting is i started seeing that you know some guys were clearly faded to becoming professional skateboarders they were really good at it i just wanna say for full disclosure i was not particularly good i kept getting injured i just i was not faded to be you know exceptional or very good at it but i love the comradery and i love the community but i also noticed that you know some people were drinking all day and other people got into hard drugs and people started to you know some of the dysfunction really started to show up yeah the fracture yeah the fracture begins exactly and so and i started seeing that lot a lot more violence you know people start getting their girlfriends pregnant they didn't have money to support those kids you know it started becoming apparent to me that there was a lot of dysfunction as well as a lot of incredible people in that community and so about that time i got a girlfriend and the other thing was i got removed from high school so i went to kind of the famedinfamous high school in palo alto gunn high school oh you went to gunn i went to gunn which is famous because it's the one of the most academically rigorous schools in the country maybe the planet people moved to the area just to send their kids there but it also has this very complicated reputations of the highest suicide rate of any school in the country the new york times has written about this so you know i would come to school every once in a while but i could tell you far more about the curbs in the front of the gunn high school parking lot than i could about anything that i learned at gunn so when they say they you were removed i mean you got you were expelled no i basically they just said you need to either start coming to school or you know you're done or you're done so i got shifted to another high school and that was same story it was just was it was a mess it just fell apart and so at one point i was brought in i have a kind of vague recollection of this but i was brought in to have a discussion with a school counselor and i don't think i've ever told this story before and there was someone sitting in the corner this guy was sitting in the corner and he didn't introduce himself and pretty soon i realized when i was like i think they're gonna take me away like i started realized 'cause they realized my mom wasn't really able to control me wasn't really in a place to support me at that time and that's what they did they took me away they took me into a place up the peninsula which was not a jail and it wasn't a hospital it was just sort of a place where they put kids that were like some kind of gv warehousing situation yeah a lot of psychologists lot of locks on doors lot of lot of kids that there were 12 of us in there at any one time it was locked down and the first night there i remember i had a roommate who was like really into cutting on himself that kind of thing and he told me he was like \"look if you just do what they say here you'll be outta here in like a month and if you don't you're gonna be here a very long time\" and i remember being pretty frightened for the first time and at that point i was like oh my goodness like this is bad you know like this is bad i'm a long way it's so hard for me to imagine i know i know this given you know who you are and what you do now i know and you know and it was literally like the kind of one phone call a day kind of thing so actually i called i was skateboarding for a company in san francisco i think they put me on out of sympathy and i called this guy up and i said \"look i've you know they locked me up i don't know what to do can you help me\" and he get and i'll never forget i wanna say his name because you're the most normal guy i know well he's like the least likely of that crowd exactly for that to happen so in any event i was permitted to go back to school eventually provided that i went to therapy and so i started going to weekly therapy which in the early 90s was kind of a weird thing you would wouldn't admit it to your friends but tweets skateboard around stanford campus i was doing my thing and then twice a week i would go in and see this therapist he's a remarkable guy because a he had deep training in the mind right and we started talking about what was going on and he really picked up on the fact that there was essentially no structure no home life for me but that i had a strong drive and i was really interested in learning i mean i was i was enthusiastic and motivated enough to you know skateboard as hard as i could even though i wasn't gonna go anywhere with it so at that point and the fact that i had a girlfriend i started looking for something that i could do and i started at one point i thought i'd join the fire service 'cause it seemed like the comradery was good at that point i started strengthening my body a bit because i didn't wanna keep getting hurt so i started running i started lifting weights a football coach at gunn actually turned me on to fitness it's actually an interesting guy he wrote the script for that movie \"mr mom\" oh my god yeah because his wife bet him that he couldn't do what she could do which was stay home with the kids and he was this big strong football coach and so he made her a bet and he lost and so he wrote that script michael keaton played the yeah so he taught me he was like look you know you can't even do a pull up you need to start doing your pullups and you start running you know and he said the fire service might be good for you so i was spinning out but there were people that were willing to kind of you know point me in the right direction so what ended up happening was my high school girlfriend went off to college and i didn't you know i didn't know what i was gonna do so i actually went and i lived in the parking lot outside her dormitory i just wanted to be near her she was my family at that point a college locally or she was at uc santa barbara so you just drove down and i just drove down and i just camped out in the parking lot and people and i was starting to get into some martial arts and thai boxing then so i think i was teaching some thai boxing selfdefense stuff on campus and doing this kind of thing and by the end of that year i realized that i should probably apply to college so i applied to ucsp and somehow i got in lord knows how i got in i did 'cause i did eventually graduate high school barely got in and then after a year i just completely flailed it you know i wasn't going to class i was getting into fights a lot of that kind of mischief and kind of wildness was still in me and what ended up happening was i got into a physical altercation on july 4th 1994 with like a bunch of guys and at the end of that i walked back to the place i was staying and of course i wasn't paying rent because i had learned in those years like you can just squat in an empty house so you know it's isla vista california you know so i was really running wild and went back and just i realized i was like this picture is really bad you know at some point this isn't gonna be like a kid who had some problems this is gonna be truly it's not cute anymore it's not cute anymore and no one no one's gonna make excuses about your upbringing or the lack of parenting it just becomes you just you're gonna end up being a ward of the state i mean you were it sounds like you were you were almost a feral animal totally feral actually and i have some close friends that's how they they referred to me that feral and it's funny even to this day i mean i'll get to where this eventually took me but even to this day when i go into a home where it's clearly like a loving home where there's kids are happy and there's good food and it's warm and cozy i always feel this thing like wow like amazing like i sort of wanna be adopted by them immediately but you know i'm 45 years old so that's not appropriate at this age what's so interesting i keep thinking about david epstein's book \"range\" did you read this book which is basically this thesis that some of the most successful people are not you know we suspect that you know the great talents of the world across all disciplines are the people who discover their passion at an early age and practice it voraciously for many many many years but in fact it's people more like yourself who've dabbled in all different kinds of things who end up being ultimately you know the most proficient at their selected skillset and when i look at your experience i see trauma i see adventure i see you know all these obstacles that you've had to face and overcome and manage on your own essentially right and all of those really informed perfectly the things that you're interested in and what you explore today in your lab yeah it really did you know i think that i'm so grateful for those years i wouldn't wish them on any kid because i think having a secure loving environment at home is so key and you know i should say about a third of the kids that i grew up with in that environment that whole skateboarding punk rock culture about a third have gone on to found companies or professional skateboarders about a third just kind of drifted off and about a third are dead or incarcerated you know a huge number and so there's real value in having a support system that's clear but it exposed me to all these things like addictions schizophrenia rage like all these incredible elements like i was never really into drinking and drugs i could drink or not drink it just wasn't i wasn't drawn to it but other people they took one sip and it was like that was their thing it was like the magic elixir for them and so you know i was observing what was happening and then after that you know that july 4th '94 incident was i realized this is it you know it's now or never it really was one of those moments you know you hear about those moments but it was me realizing i'm living in this squat where i've got a pet ferret my girlfriend's gone she broke up with me she was smart enough to break up with me you know i'm getting in fights i'm working at a bagel shop i'm barely making ends meet and at that point i just made the decision i just said okay look i'm not gonna be a professional athlete i think i'm pretty good at memorizing things i think i have an interest in people i'm going to just decide i just decided to do school i decided that was the that was the track and so like some people pick the military because it's like if you know what to expect at least in terms of the you know the passages that you're gonna go through and for me that was school and so i had decided get back in school i moved into a studio apartment by myself i quit partying completely i didn't go to parties i got really serious about fitness so i just started running and lifting weights and i studied you went like henry rollins style i did yeah i did it's a lot of selfawareness you know i mean people go into the military because on some level i mean some people do because they're there's some yearning for having that structure imposed upon their lives but you constructed that kind of structure for yourself yeah i think i was really afraid i think i was like you know and i and these days you know 'cause of my lab studies fear and i get into this whole thing around mindsets and people always ask me like is it better to do something from a place of love or fear like depends and at that point fear was the best motivator for me and i just basically worked like crazy and it's interesting because i didn't have a mentor or someone to bring me to that but once i started doing that you know there was one professor in particular who took note he was like \"oh you know you seem really interested in this stuff\" and i was like yeah 'cause he was teaching me about depression schizophrenia neurochemicals i thought i was totally turned on by the world of neuroscience it didn't it wasn't even called neuroscience back then but this one guy harry carlisle he was teaching me about thermal regulation and how the brain works and how receptors in the skin relate to perceptions in the mind and he also had a deep sensitivity to mental disease and i'd seen a lot of that you know i'd seen a lot of depression and anxiety in my own family i had had a friend commit suicide another friend becomes schizophrenic i think he's still walking the mission district of san francisco now seeing some friends become addicts and so here was someone explaining that there's actually an underlying basis for this and i just poured myself into it is that the same guy who you know would smoke underneath the vacuum hood and stuff like that like a bit of an  yeah he was amazing so he was a favorite teacher of many students but if you could get into his lab then you were kind of one of the chosen ones i guess he's like the perfect mentor at the perfect time for you yeah so he used to drink coffee in lab which you're not supposed to do he's just smoke cigarettes in lab in the fume hood and they used to come and yell at him and he would do it anyway and i thought you know this guy he doesn't even know what it is but you know he's a punk rocker and he doesn't even know and so you know he gave me an opportunity to work in his lab and at some point he told me if you go to graduate school they'll actually pay you to do science and what ended up happening at that point was i hit a brick wall because i was i had a lot of resentment toward my dad i felt you know here's my dad he was a scientist he had you know left us all this kind of thing and i realized if i didn't do this if i didn't take this opportunity it was going to be the most foolish thing ever you know what am i gonna do to spite my you know my parents you know i was 20 years old at that point so i just made the decision i'm gonna get a phd and become a professor i'm going to get tenure and be like this guy you know this guy who has looked like he had a pretty good life to me and so that's pretty much how i spent the you know the last 25 years of my life is doing experiments it worked out it worked out is it a lot of work i mean i didn't have the power of concentration i hadn't read all the good books that gunn high school students read growing up i had to learn how to speak properly i learned how to learn how to think properly and really learn how to commit to something that was very linear and at times was very painful and i went to some pretty extreme things i you know i actually used to set a timer and i wouldn't allow myself to get out of the chair until i was the timer went off so and i would experience extreme agitation but over time i got pretty good and now i can do long stints of work without any breaks and yeah it worked out it developed that neuroplasticity in your favor ultimately you're always a reader though right i loved books so i would you know i would hide in the tower books section in the evenings and i would read everything about fitness psychology anything i could i've always devoured information my favorite book when i was a kid was the \"encyclopedia\" or the \"guinness book of world records\" so i was like when i was a little kid i'd walk around the aspen center for physics and i would tell anyone i didn't even ask them if they want to hear about like the what's the world's smallest ethereum mammal you know i would like it could tell you all these facts that were kind of meaningless at the time but i've always been fascinated by the inventory of different animals on the planet and their different behaviors and so yeah voracious reader and still now i love i love information well as a neuroscientist i mean you're your own patient i mean the fact that you were able to you know turn your life around in such a dramatic fashion and do it essentially through sheer will and you know setting up practices that would feel you you in that right direction and then being available when those mentors showed up from the from the you know the early therapist sounds like that guy almost saved your life right he absolutely saved my life he gave me the book \"wherever you go there you are\" the jon kabatzinn book and he said no pressure but if you can develop a mindfulness practice where you can sit still for like 10 minutes a day it'll serve you very well so i started doing that like he could've he could've told me to hang out of a window by my ankles i would have done it i think there was a there was a self preservation thing was kicking in for me so i got very interested in mindfulness meditation he also it was i think quite smart in saying look there's a whole world of psychedelic drugs that are powerful in influencing the mind he said \"if you're going to explore those wait until your brain has already developed\" which i think is a controversial statement in and of itself he so he actively discouraged me to go down that path which i think was the right thing given i was a minor you know and nowadays there's all this discussion now about psychedelics and their power and i think they are very interesting compounds but he really steered me towards behavioral practices like what could i do each day from waking up to going to sleep that would serve my mental health and my productivity well i owe him a tremendous amount and especially because he wasn't just in the psychoanalytic theory he also was like cognitive behavioral he understood the power of practices not just discussing issues yeah to begin a meditation practice at that age in the mid 90s that's pretty radical yeah i felt it was funny 'cause i thought if i didn't sit in the lotus position like i wasn't doing it properly you know back then there was all this stuff around it was very mystical and in my family 'cause my dad's very conservative and my mom was a little bit more of a free spirit i was taught that anything that related to hippie culture was doomed to fail and cause problems and then anything that was related to like conservative culture was faded to advance the progress of humanity it turned out neither one was true of course so i but i needed people to push me in those directions lift weights run meditate do your schoolwork do your homework and so i think i you know now i have a good relationship with my parents but i think i had to go out into the world and find those you know sort of paternal and maternal figures because they weren't in my home i needed to find those do you look back on your upbringing with gratitude like how do you reflect on that experience and how it informs how you think about what you do now i'm immensely grateful for it because you know where i'm at today is you know my lab works on a number of issues related you know sort of hardcore neurobiology of regenerating the brain you know trying to fix basically cure blindness and repair visual systems but also things related to you know fear courage mindset stress anxiety trauma et cetera and the early seed of seeing how science is done definitely gave me an advantage i won't lie you know i seeing how scientists interact and behave and understanding that they are just people 'cause a lot of what was discussed in my home was about the people not just the science they do that really gave me an advantage and then seeing all that dysfunction and realizing that the human animal is amazing at making plans at modifying its brain if it wants to but the human brain and the human animal are also dreadfully bad at doing what's best for us because of this what i think it comes down to is the fact that our reward systems are not designed for things that are just good for us they're designed for things that optimize the progression of our species but they're also they will grab on to and ratchet into any behavior that makes us feel good and so the human brain is really not optimized for making best choices and so those years of seeing all that i could testify to that yeah it's and it's i wouldn't trade those years for anything and i still have great friends in that community i mean i think you know any had i joined a different community i would have found the right people as well but to be with a you know a huge pack of feral kids at that age and to see the function and dysfunction and also it was wild it was a lot of fun i can imagine it was a lot of fun that's a whole set of stories for another time did you see that movie \"mid 90s\" \"mid 90s\" and the movie \"kids\" the larry clark movie when i saw that movie first of all i had a lot of friends that were in that movie 'cause he used actual skateboarders in \"kids\" yeah i actually knew a couple of those kids and you know it's a movie but there are a lot of things about that movie they're very accurate and when i saw that movie i was like yeah that's like right pretty much a day in the life in washington square park and you know i mean it was a little extreme on some end but you didn't know where you're gonna end up each night and that was a unique experience you know so yeah and \"mid 90s\" was really good i think it captured the essence of what it is to be a kid that's just looking for some group of people to join and skateboard is a unique sport because you get young kids and grown men and now women and girls do it as well it didn't happen so much then but now there are a lot of great awesome skateboarders that are female but they're all hanging out together you wouldn't find that in soccer you're not gonna get little kids playing with grown men so you get exposed to a lot 'cause everyone's at develop different developmental stages but yeah it was an amazing thing i wouldn't change it for anything cool well let's segue into talking about the brain and maybe we could start with you know how you think about the brain specifically like what is the brain what does it do what does it not do you know it helps us survive it's our portal into trying to make sense of the world like what's the starting point in the discussion around the brain yeah so the brain and nervous system which so it's like brain spinal cord connections with the body and back in i don't distinguish between brain and mind i think that's like an 80s discussion or earlier and i think it would take us down the wrong track so brain or mind to me is interchangeable mind body is kind of interchangeable because the brain is connected to the body and the body is connected to the brain right if i you know pinprick my hand and it hurts my brain registers it where it happens it's kind of an irrelevant discussion i think we really need to just appreciate that the nervous system is designed to orchestrate all the processes in the body not just thinking and not just behavior and really can be divided into five things so there's sensation and sensation is really bound or restricted by the receptors in the body so receptors in the eye that perceive photons light energy per se receptors in the skin that perceive pressure you know touch receptors smell taste hearing et cetera and the interesting thing about sensation and the fact that the nervous system needs to pay attention to sensation is it's nonnegotiable the nervous system of humans is designed to extract physical phenomenon from the universe that are nonnegotiable photons of light i can't see in the infrared with my eyes and i can't see ultraviolet light with my eyes and i can't perceive that because i don't have the receptors for it so you know other animals can perceive some of those things but that leads us to the next thing which is perception which is which sensations are you paying attention to so all the time you're sensing things like right now your feet are sensing the contact with your shoes but you're not thinking about it until i say that and then you shift your perception so perception is like the spotlight so the brain wants to constantly bring in sensation it's nonnegotiable what's coming in it's just dependent on your environment perception is negotiable you can control that 'cause i just said shoes and you thought about your feet and there you are then there are feelings which can be a little bit nebulous but feelings are a link between our emotion and generally invokes the body sensations in the body and concepts in the mind and what those sensations are about that's really what emotions are animals definitely experience them i'm kind of appalled to think that 10 years ago people like do animals have emotions of course they have emotions right because those are bodily sensations merged with some perceptions so of course they do and then there's thoughts and thoughts are interesting because thoughts happen spontaneously think about like a web browser that's constantly giving you popups but thoughts can also be deliberate so you and i can decide right now that we're gonna think about a plan for something or we're gonna think about what's going on in the world so thoughts happen spontaneously and they can be deliberate and then the final thing is behaviors and actions so the nervous system is responsible for sensation perception feelings thoughts and behaviors and what's interesting we start to think about that as you're like okay that's a lot but what is the nervous system really trying to accomplish like on any given day or at any moment what's it trying to accomplish and it's really trying to accomplish one thing which is to take perceptions of the outside world and merge those with perceptions of the inside world what we call interoception and to link those in a way that's operating on an environment in the appropriate way so what do i mean by that so if i'm feeling anxious and i'm in a very calm environment i'm gonna perceive that rapid heart rate and kind of feeling of agitation in my body as inappropriate for the moment right and my goal then as an organism is to adjust my level of what they call autonomic arousal or alertness down if i'm in a great party or i'm at a wedding or it's a celebration or i'm at a protest or you know then i might feel that my level of alertness is appropriate for my environment so the nervous system is in this constant dynamic interaction with the outside world and trying to figure that out one way and this can be kind of conceptualized is there's an emerging idea that's kind of interesting about impatience so we've all had the feeling of being impatient some people are far more patient than others but if you've ever been in line at the store and you feel like something's going very slowly you know the person in front of you is taking a long time they're doing some returns you're getting kind of impatient maybe you're breathing in a mask and you're like ah like you're you know what's the ideas that if you're getting a certain frequency of pulses from your body and if those pulses are coming in quickly like you're perceiving yourself that interoception quickly it's like pulse pulse pulse pulse you're gonna be more geared towards your internal representation and then you're seeing what's going on in the outside world and it seems like it's going very slowly but there are other times when you're in line at the store someone's getting some returns and you're texting on your phone or you've had a great day you've had a great run your family's in great shape and you're fine why well that frequency of those pulses that interoception is matched pretty well to your outside environment and so impatience is really when your internal sort of metronome tick tick tick tick is not matched well to the external environment there are other times when you're feeling like your internal metronome is tick tick tick and you've got a million things coming at you through email or texts you've got a bunch of things and you're feeling overwhelmed and tired well in either case there's nothing right or wrong it's just your body and your brain are trying to say what's going on in the outside world and how well matched am i to it right so if you think about some of the sort of core practices of mindfulness and selfregulation of like focusing on breathing or focusing on you know state of mind a lot of that is trying to bring more awareness to your internal state but what our brain is normally doing when our eyes are open and we're interacting in the world is we're constantly trying to update our internal state to match external demands of the world and this hearkens back to a you know like a really early design of all nervous systems which is how do you take an organism that needs certain things food water mates reproduction shelter how do you move that organism how do you create a system that will do that in best relation to the environment and so what mother nature has done is designed a system a series of systems let's just take agitation and stress for one if an animal or a human is very thirsty you feel kind of agitated might get up and get a drink of water if you're very thirsty it can put you into a state of panic if you're extremely thirsty and water is a limited resource you might even result the violence to get it or negotiation of some sort that you wouldn't if you were calmer so the stress and agitation were designed to actually mobilize the body to take us into the direction of something that's adaptive so you can start to see these kind of core elements of what the brain and nervous system do sensation perception feeling thought and action and this constant challenge of trying to match our internal state to the external real estate the outside world and you start to see that the sensations that we call stress or impatience or calm are really the result of those attempts that the nervous system is trying to perform that's a lot to take in and super interesting and it you know it's prompting in me this you know attempt to try to wrap my head around what within the brain is mutable which is kind of you know what your work is all about versus what is immutable like you were talking about thoughts like pop up windows on a browser you know some sometimes our brains are just doing what they do and that there are things that we can do like mindfulness and breath work and the practices that you're talking about hypnosis which is another thing that you're involved in to help you know help us like take better manage better that process to kind of take the reins and be more in charge rather than be prey or victim to these kinds of things that just occur without our conscious awareness well i think that you know in terms of value of understanding the nervous system and where it can be steered it's absolutely clear that the nervous system can change in response to experience so this thing we call neuroplasticity is really that it's the brain's ability to modify itself in response to experience and i think it's important to understand that from birth till about age 25 the brain is extremely malleable in a kind of almost passive way where kids are exposed to things and the brain is just wiring up i mean the brain is designed to adjust itself in order to be in concert with its surroundings and to optimize that just the way we described it a minute ago like a way that a child can learn a language very quickly or three languages play a guitar or something like that yeah without an accent you know three languages without an accent it's remarkable and try and do that after age 25 it's very challenging and so the brain is basically designed to be customized in the early part of life and then to implement those algorithms in that circuitry for the rest of your of its life and so the brain can change in adulthood and it can change provided that there's an emphasis on some perceptual event so in other words if you wanna change your brain as an adult let's say you wanna be less anxious you wanna learn a new language you wanna be more functional in some way presumably the key thing is to bring focus to some particular perception of something that's happening during the learning process and the reason for that is that there's a neurochemical system involving acetylcholine and it comes from these two little nuclei down in the base of the brain called the nucleus basalis all day long you're doing things in a reflexive way but when you do something and you think about it very intensely acetylcholine is released from basalis at the precise neurons that were involved in that behavior and it marks those for change during sleep or during deep rest later so for people that wanna change their brain the power of focus is really the entry point and the ability to access deep rest and sleep because most people don't realize this but neuroplasticity is triggered by intense focus but neuroplasticity occurs during deep sleep and rest and we can talk about how to optimize those different brain functions one of the things that's really important also to think about how the brain works in terms of plasticity and all this stuff is what the brain really wants to do is also pass as much of what it does off to reflexive behavior as possible so when we're talking about focus i think it can get a little bit vague but it might be useful to think about like what exactly is focus and what triggers plasticity so the brain loves to be able to just do things pick up coffee cups and drink and walk and talk and do things and not put much energy into it when we decide to focus what the brain really does is it switches on a set of circuits then all the frontal cortex and nucleus basalis and some others and it's trying to understand duration how long something's gonna last path what's gonna happen and outcome what ultimately is gonna happen so duration path and outcome you know the events of early 2020 are a good example of this one of the reasons why it's so exhausting to be alive in 2020 is because we are now having to pay attention to duration path and outcome how long is this thing gonna last when are you know when are they gonna open up all businesses did i touch that door handle does it matter you know who are the experts are there any experts you know there are a lot of questions whereas normally we can just move through life without having to do all that analysis so if it's a simple example like trying to learn a new language or a new motor skill or a new way of conceptualizing something maybe somebody who's in a therapeutic process and they're trying to work through a trauma or something like that duration path and outcome is built into the networks of the brain we can do that very easily but it takes work and it almost has a feeling of underlying agitation and frustration and that's because of the circuits that turn on before acetylcholine are of the stress system so when you or i decide we're gonna learn something and really dig in norepinephrine which is adrenaline is secreted in the brainstem and in the body and it brings about a state of alertness then our attention which is mostly a diffuse light is brought to a particular duration path and outcome analysis this would be thinking about what somebody is saying what are they really trying to say a hard passage of reading a hard you know set of math problems you know a challenging physical workout when you do that these two systems have to work very hard and the adult brain doesn't really wanna change the algorithms they learned in childhood but if you do those two things you have alertness and focus the acetylcholine and the norepinephrine converge to mark those synopsis for change and so so the way to think about neuroplasticity if one wants to change their brain is bring about the most intense concentration you can to something and then later bring about the least amount of concentration to that thing so i'll talk about that in a second but there were some studies that were done at stanford by a guy named eric knudsen that showed that plasticity in the adult brain any age can be as robust as it is in childhood as fast and as dramatic provided the focus is there and it's all contingent on this acetylcholine molecule coming from nucleus basalis so you say well how do you do that how do you get it you know well i've got friends that you nicorette thinking that's gonna get them there because nicorette is a nicotinic acetylcholine agonist but that's gonna globally increase acetylcholine so i always tell them that's not the right approach the right approach is to bring as much focus to a behavior or to a thought or to an action pattern and there has to be a sense of urgency so what knudsen lab showed and another lab at ucf mike merzenich's lab showed is that if there's a serious contingency like in order to get your ration of food each day you have to learn this thing the degree of plasticity is remarkable but if there isn't an incentive it just isn't gonna happen so the circuits in the brain that mother nature set up are designed to be anchored to a real need and people always say to me well should i do something out of love and a real desire to learn or should it be out of fear but either one works the sense of urgency is just acetylcholine it's norepinephrine that's all it is it doesn't the brain doesn't have a recognition of whether or not something is pleasureful or not until later once you start accomplishing your goal the reward systems like dopamine start kicking in but i think if people are interested in modifying their brain for the better at least some you know top contour understanding of how urgency and focus must converge for that to happen can be useful because i think there's a lot of attention paid to whether or not something feels like flow or whether or not it's see what i call highly desirable states or whether or not you can you can eat a plant out of the ground that will magically put your brain into a state of plasticity and the answer is yes such plants exist but what's missing is the focus component if that work is not done with a particular end goal in mind you'll get plasticity but you'll get plasticity in a kind of across the board it's like learning nine lang learning a little bit of nine languages all at once is not gonna make you speak coherently in any one of them so focus is the key right i mean this idea of flow is so much in the vernacular now and you know my sense is that people are trying to measure their level of engagement against some sort of theoretical idea of what it's like to be in that flow state and if they're not experiencing it they feel like they're doing it wrong or they're they feel guilty or they beat themselves up and for me it's a lot of it is just hard work like right now i'm trying to finish this book and i should have been working on this book for like the last nine months right and i just couldn't couldn't get it together like it's a collaborative project so there's a lot of different people that are involved in this and they've been working diligently sort of daily you know putting this thing together and i've just been focusing on the podcast and been unable to immerse myself in this project because i know from past book projects when i go in i go all in like the addict in me kicks in and it's like it just becomes my universe and i've been completely paralyzed from taking that on and so i've dithered away most of the quarantine without being productive on this project and then about 10 days ago we had a meeting and we established this deadline at you know july 10th to turn this thing in and it was like a switch got flicked and i went all in and it's all i can think about now and in fact everything else feels like extraneous and a distraction i just wanna get back so i can focus on this thing and 10 days ago i couldn't get myself into that position and it's made me think about like what is going on in my brain that you know it's such a drastic state change and what did i do to switch that while a deadline was imposed upon me and whatever happened neurochemically with that set in motion like a chain reaction of events that got me into the chair and once i began the project for me it's all about like momentum right it's like to start getting to the starting line and beginning is so hard like i will just go forever without doing it and then i'm in and then i'm all in 110 and i'm like why can't i just why can't i be that person who just worked on it you know an hour and a half every day for the last three months well i can offer some potential explanations i can relate and none of it involves a flow state it's all hard yeah and you know i'm friends with steven kotler i think flow and i think the chicks in mohali who originated this thing of flow is really interesting but i say right now the most we can say about flow mechanistically is backwards it spells wolf we don't really understand flow now people have come up with these theories it's like you know hypo hyper frontality i haven't seen the data and i'm not picking on anybody i'm putting that out there as a prompt for people to discover this i think that and to work on it i think it's a really interesting highly desirable state but i think we need to get comfortable as a culture in trying to understand our species and how we work that the early stages of hard work and focus are gonna feel like agitation stress and confusion because that's the norepinephrine and adrenaline system kicking in none of us would expect to walk into the gym and do our pr lift or you know a performer go do something without warming up the brain also needs to warm up and start to hone in which circuits are gonna be active and it's unreasonable for us to think \"oh i've got an hour i'm gonna plop down and write beautifully for an hour my best work\" we need to accept that there's a period of agitation and stress that accompanies the dropping into these highly concentrated states now in terms of the reward that accompanies the feeling that we're funneling into that groove of being productive in one regime like for you writing this book the dopamine system is really important to understand so we've talked about norepinephrine kind of gets you going acetylcholine is the spotlight of attention the dopamine system is mother nature's hardwired ancient system in all animals including humans to put us on the right path now it's a lot of people talk about dopamine as this thing that you get when you publish the book or when you get the book deal or when something wonderful happens like your child's born and that's true but dopamine's main role is to be released anytime you achieve a milestone or you think you're on the right path and when the dopamine system is tethered to a particular pattern of focus remember duration path and outcome so it's like okay you sit down maybe you don't get much text out but then the next day you get 800 words of really solid text and you feel good like i'm into this what does that dopamine system do the dopamine system takes the norepinephrine which is normally rate limiting like at some point there's so much norepinephrine that you quit and we can talk about that it's actually the substrate for quitting dopamine can push that noradrenaline back down that adrenaline back down and give you more room more space to do duration path and outcome work highly focused work and i'm making duration path outcomes synonymous with highly focused work why would this happen so let's think about an animal let's think about a deer that wakes up and is thirsty and it's wandering out looking for water that animal needs water it doesn't know that it needs water it experiences agitation the same way that a baby feels agitation when it wants food but it doesn't know it needs food it just feels agitation and cries and a caretaker comes hopefully that deer is now foraging for something that it needs and let's say it smells water 'cause a deer can actually do that and arrives at a stream and takes a sip of water there's dopamine released then that puts it on a path to maybe a larger lake or something of that sort or to be able to go cheap food so when we are on the right path and we hit a milestone dopamine is released and it tends to tighten our focus more for that activity so the dopamine this is why drugs of abuse and why alcoholism and some process addictions which are behavioral addictions are so dangerous because they a lot of those drugs of abuse are dopamine so it becomes this cyclical loop where there's no other behavior that can evoke the same level of release in fact i sort of define addiction as a progressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure and i say that because it really is the way that the dopamine system works normally the dopamine system is designed to be generic it's designed to get me to do lots of things social quality social interactions you know work exercise all those things just like the stress system is designed to get me out of bed in the morning cortisol pulse is what gets me out of bed in the morning it's also what leads me to or led me to pursue a career in science out of fear initially and eventually pleasure so the dopamine system is tethered to those states of focus and it's what mother nature designed so that the neuroplasticity would occur and you would want to continue those behaviors again in the future that deer needs to know and remember and create a memory not just aware that stream is but the process of oh when i feel that agitation i'm gonna get up and go down this particular path and so people think of the dopamine system as this kind of like catch all for reward oh you get likes on instagram and it makes you feel good that's not really how it works and the important thing to understand is when you start getting a convergence of norepinephrine so that level of agitation duration path outcome acetylcholine and dopamine now you're starting to wire in the behaviors that make people really good at certain things now in a functional view of this so not addiction what this means is that for any of us success in any endeavor is very closely related to how much focus we can bring to that endeavor and the reward system you start to realize is entirely internal no one's coming along and cramming dopamine in your ear or dripping it in your brain it's all internal and this starts to bring us into the kind of like discussion around mindsets because so my colleague carol dweck who popularized this thing growth mindset it's and again a very misunderstood concept it's the idea that we can change so that's built into that but the discovery of growth mindset was of these kids that actually really enjoyed doing problem sets that they knew they couldn't get right but for them they would get this like dopamine release from just focusing on the problem they liked doing puzzles they couldn't get right it sounds crazy but inevitably those kids are very good at puzzles and very good at math and on these kinds of things so growth mindset is i believe if a certain neuroscience lens on growth mindset would be that the agitation and stress that you feel at the beginning of something and when you're trying to lean into it and you can't focus is just a recognized gate you have to pass that through that gate to get to the focus component and then if you can reward the effort process you really start to feel joy and low levels of excitement in the effort process that's that buffering of adrenaline that's that feeling like yes i've got a lot of adrenaline in my system but i'm on the right path it feels good to walk up this hill so to speak and when you start to bring those neural circuits together you really start to create a whole set of circuits that are designed to be exported to any behavior you want so if it's writing a book great if it's podcasting great if it's building a business great if it's you know building a terrific relationship great then the circuits that mother nature is designer incredibly generic so that we could adapt to whatever it is that we need to do and i think the misunderstanding around how these circuits work has led to this idea that there's some secret entry point maybe marked flow on the door and there's a trampoline up to that door and you just open that door and you're gonna be in it and nothing could be further from the truth and anyone who's done well in any career or athletic pursuit knows this but unfortunately there's a kind of obsession with the idea that it's all supposed to feel good and it does feel good but there's a whole staircase in which it feels kind of lousy yeah i mean the feel good aspect of that experience is very subtle and i think you know in a kind of global way what you're talking about is falling in love with the process like you have to push this gate open which might require you know more effort than you're comfortable with but once you push through it is about you know that daily the daily rigor and the tiny wins that you get from that rather than you know it's easy to you know you set a goal but that goal becomes very abstract right and it's those tiny little things that you're getting done every day that bring you that internal satisfaction that are like calibrating that plasticity is that what you're saying yeah absolutely and what's incredible is the extent to which the mind and thoughts remember earlier we were talking about how thoughts are spontaneous you can't control them negative thoughts traumatic thoughts bad thoughts trying to suppress those is futile if there's one message i can send people it's just don't even work at that but work at the process of introducing thoughts as almost like you would introduce actions because we can introduce thoughts and you know carol dweck has talked about this that positive selftalk is not the same thing as growth mindset because positive selftalk is almost always linked to the ultimate outcome if i'm losing badly in something and i tell myself i'm doing great i know that i'm lying there's no dopamine release from that and you know a lot of the selfhelp wellness culture of the 80s and 90s was like it's impossible to be in a bad mood if you're smiling we won't have any depression on the planet if that's true there's probably some feedback from the face to the brain but it's not that simple but the idea that you can self reward the effort process is extremely powerful because what it means is that if you can recognize agitation stress and confusion as an entry point to where you eventually wanna go i do think that just that even just mental recognition can allow people to pass through it more easily they think they're doing something wrong and then rewarding yourself when you achieve any milestone like you know running to a particular location if you're trying to run a long distance and then registering that as a partial win what we know is that the dopamine that's released in response to that suppresses the total amount of adrenaline and gives you more room more time more energy to run in the running example and this is anchored in a real scientific result so last year there was a paper published that essentially was asking why any human or animal quits at any behavior now certain behaviors like i can't lift a car unless it's a very small car i can't lift a car but if we're talking about running or we're talking about long bouts of work the question is why do we quit like what is that and it turns out that every time we exert effort a certain amount of noradrenaline in the brain is released and there's a sort of a counter in the brainstem and at some point enough noradrenaline is released and it shuts down cognitive control deliberate control over the motor circuitry and we quit that's it but the thing that can restore those levels or it can sort of reset those levels lower and give us more gas more mileage is dopamine and it makes perfect sense because our species had to move against very challenging things in nature and in certain so in culture at every stage of our evolution including now 2020 is a good example of this and when a good example would be if you're really slogging it out and things are miserable just think like the worst family vacation everything's a disaster or a very hard physical event and someone cracks a joke you're almost immediately feel a sense of relief you see this in the team that wins the super bowl both teams slogged it out you have to believe they were both at max effort the entire game look at the team that wins they have extra energy they're jumping all over the place so it can't be physical energy it can't be glycogen related it's not ketone related it's nothing in the body in that sense it's dopamine's ability to take that level of norepinephrine and smack it back down and so we can learn this right i mean i think this is where there's real power like in your story or the story that i'm familiar with from your book like the ability to push through those pain points is something that we really can export to other aspects of life because it's the same neurochemicals that are involved so when you get to a particular location or maybe your recall you know a portion where you're just you're feeling lousy you know you're injured or you feel like you're hurt and you can reframe it mentally and think i'm actually still on the ladder i'm still holding onto a wrong i know that at least that much i'm still breathing i know that much and the lift that we get is not some psychological pumpup it's a neurochemical thing it's dopamine suppressing norepinephrine and saying you're on the right path you can keep going it's a permission to keep going and we grant that permission to ourselves no one grants that permission to us i think one of the other kind of misconceptions that we wanna dissolve is this idea that external rewards can actually propel us down long paths of success and high performance they can't it's internal rewards no that's a sustainable fuel source yeah yeah i have a friend from the seal team and somebody asked us recently we were giving a talk and somebody said \"how can i make sure that i continue to self reward and i'm not driven by these extra rewards how can i continue to have that drive\" and his answer was very good he said \"give away all the external rewards\" you know now not everyone can afford to do that it's just about you and you it's just you and you and the more attach there's a famous stanford study done at being nursery school probably not far where from where you were in the dormitory there was a little nursery school in escondido village and they did a study where they looked at kids that like to playing during their recess it's all recess in nursery school but they're drawing and they took the kids that really liked to draw and they started giving them little gold stars on their drawings and then they liked the gold stars for a kid that's an extrinsic reward and then they stopped doing that and the kids stop drawing they just they associated the good feeling of doing it with the external rewards we have to be very cautious about how much of our internal dopamine we attach to external rewards if we wanna continue to grow and pursue and focus and work hard if you just wanna get to someplace and cash in then fine but most people find themselves in a pretty miserable place because their dopamine was so attached to external rewards they need more and more of that well the why has to be deeper than that i mean the thing that i kind of always default to when i hit that breaking point or you know i'm training or i'm racing or whatever and i'm at that stage where it's just like i can't go any further the first thing i do is i reflect inward on why i'm doing this to begin with like what is the you know what is the value system that i'm trying to tap into what is it that i'm trying to express like what got me to this point so it's a reminder and then i just set like i just say well i'm just gonna get to the next lamppost or i'm gonna you know get to the next intersection or whatever it is i break it down into the tiny i'll quit after that like the more i can just root myself in the present moment and distill it down into the tiniest of digestible chunks that's the only way i can you know continue to move forward and i've learned over time that the more i do that then you know suddenly i'll find myself in a different mental like it will shift right just because i feel that way in that moment is not determinative of how i'm gonna feel 10 minutes later absolutely there's an interesting process that occurs when people start to realize that rewards are all internal and what they start to do is they start linking this duration path outcome thing to their internal rewards and so to put this simply one of the most powerful things that any person can do is to learn to control this idea of duration path and outcome and attach an internal sense of reward just that you're doing well to reward yourself mentally just say \"i'm doing well i'm actually on the right path\" to do that inside of the demands that come from the external world the more often that we can self reward some aspect of the process provided it's in the right direction of what we're trying to achieve the more energy we're gonna have for that the more focus we're gonna have for that and remember that the reason i say energy i don't throw that around loosely is that limiting amount of noradrenaline is constantly being kept at bay you literally keep buffering the quit response and so when people start realizing that if they set the goals inside of the larger goal and self reward each one of those they essentially have an infinite amount of energy to pursue those goals they have an infinite amount of focus to pursue those goals you see this most in the special operations community and people that are selected essentially for this process it's one of the things that's been intriguing to me i have some friends from the seal teams and i don't begin to really understand the real work that they do deployed 'cause i've never done that kind of work but i've always been intrigued by the selection process the socalled buds process right because carrying logs and getting in cold water and all that that's not really how the work is that's really not what the work is about so the selection process is interesting because everyone shows up fit motivated and convinced that they're not gonna quit i mean i think like there might be a couple of days you'll just show up to show up but everybody is absolutely convinced and then a very small subset of them make it through and i'd be willing to bet that the ones that make it through of course they're gritty and resilient but they all are essentially right so that's necessary but not sufficient obviously otherwise they everyone would make it through the people that make it through somehow are able to tap into a process maybe it's a reward process maybe it's through self punishment maybe it's through self reward in the positive sense but they're able to control something inside an environment that is not controlled by them it's controlled by the instructors and i've always been struck by the fact that in order to to not in order to get through you just have to not quit remember people aren't being deselected they're not saying get out of here you're not good enough you're not people are deciding that for themselves and so it's interesting because it brings about a realworld experiment of people who are quitting and i believe they're quitting because they can't manage these neurotransmitters and the people when i say manage i think that the people that get through knowing some of these people quite well had an internal process by which they could reward themselves for doing something that might've just look trivial to everybody else but it gave them more gas more energy and what's interesting is the process the kind of unconscious genius of the buds process is that they've picked two sensory events that are across the board challenging for everybody one is cold water which is great because it most of the time it can't kill you right it's not like heat which can kill you it's cold water and sleep deprivation and so the ability to do these like what i'm calling dpos this duration path and outcome steps and procedures is great on when you're rested you know you know when you have when you're well fed well slept you can do anything you can be in any hard conversation you can work through anything so what they do is they start taking the autonomic nervous system which is these deep reserves of the nervous system that when our autonomic nervous system is off it starts making us pay more attention to how we feel than the demands of the world around us remember that basic challenge in the nervous system and so sleep deprivation is the best way that you can pull somebody down from their ability to analyze duration path and outcome and reward themselves sleep deprivation is the way in which you essentially pull apart the nervous system and the way that it wants to function because it's very easy again rested to do all this but so what they do is they're sleep deprived people they put them in cold water they're trying to get them more in touch with the way that they feel inside than what they need to do in response to the external demands everyone i know that's made it through that process did it slightly differently but i'll tell you how they didn't do it they didn't do it through sheer grit and determination they did it through attaching a sense of meaning they did it by micro slicing the day or slicing the day into a series of meals that they just needed to get to and then rewarding themselves for getting to that next milestone so they don't know i mean most of them you know probably had very low concept of dopamine and norepinephrine but that's the process that's also the process i think that allows someone to finish an ultra i've never run an ultra but i think that process of self reward is grit and resilience in a kind of neurochemical definition and i think it's the thing that anybody can tap into and i think it's therefore i think it's so key because i think people think that it's just so key that people understand excuse me that these circuits are not unique to people who run ultras or people that make it through you know stringent filter special operations command these it's the same thing that anyone can do it is interesting yeah the ultimate determinant isn't your physical conditioning and yet that's what everybody focuses on it's what's going on in you know internally mentally neurochemically that's making the difference and the people that are able to best calibrate that and find these you know strategies for managing are the ones that get through whether it is an ultra or buds and buds is like this perfect it's almost like its own lab right for studying human resilience in a certain respect but you have actually taken some of these people and tested them in your lab including david goggins right so what do you do when you when these people visit you and you're like i'm gonna deconstruct you here figure out what makes you tick yeah so i had the good fortune of meeting david at a consulting event a few years ago and i guess i should just say david you probably know this already but he is every bit is intense as he comes across yeah i mean what you see online his private persona is yeah it's exactly the same what you see is what you get really wonderful and obviously extremely impressive human being david anecdote so the night before we had this event he came out to the lab my lab we do we study fear we study courage we say resilience and we say the underlying neurochemical substrates for those so we had a bunch of guys there a couple of team guys some other folks and we bring them in this little room and we do virtual reality there and one of the things that we used to scare people or to generate a sense of autonomic arousal is this experience of diving with great white sharks which of course you're not in water you're in the laboratory but it's very immersive and for people that are afraid of sharks it can be quite scary not always but we also have heights we have claustrophobia we got something where you can feel spiders crawling all over your body if you're an arachnophobe you know if you have a pain point we find it do you spend time trying to figure out what that pain point is we do and we do it through some very covert methodology that involves ai and some fun tools a bunch of weird questions that right all right let's just say this from the moment you step into our laboratory we're studying you so the now i know and yeah exactly so what was fun was you know so i sort of explained what the platform was and what we were gonna do and david said he goes \"i don't like sharks\" and i was like all right well and so then you know this was not a typical experimental day in the lab so i just kind of at one point i finished describing what the tech is and how we're going to wire people in and then i said \"so who wants to go first\" and he's like i'll go right of course and what was funny to me at that moment i realized this is interesting because he he was very explicit about the fact he didn't like sharks he was very explicit about the fact that he was going to be first you know first man in i mean it would be inappropriate for me to describe his data right and we didn't do a fullblown experiment but what i can say is he's whatever it is that david has figured out how to do it clearly involves taking whatever adrenaline pulse he feels and understanding something fundamental to biology which is that adrenaline response was designed to move us not to keep us stationary he uses behavior as the way to shift sensation perception feelings and thoughts he understands how to run that program in the right direction whereas most people when they don't like what they feel they start negotiating sensation which will never work they start trying to control their perception which is hard right they're like i'm not gonna think about that or i'll think about it differently very hard to control the mind with the mind he knows that's a tough one yeah feelings lord knows what those are and how to control them i mean we'll eventually figure that out as a field but thoughts are complicated so he just goes immediately into action he goes forward towards it so when he says just for clarity when he says \"i don't like sharks\" he's basically saying put me in the shark tank like he's cuing you to say this is the thing i'm afraid of and i'm gonna be the first one to volunteer and i know you're gonna put me in the shark tank if i tell you that right exactly and i think and i obviously can't speak for him but one of the things i think is very clear is that he's tapped into this neuroplasticity process through the door through the portal of agitation and stress he's figured out the and this is really the holy grail of neuroscience is how can i modify my brain well you modify it by placing yourself into discomfort and using that as a propeller to move you into action and you know a couple of years later when david was working on his book and i heard the book was coming out i think i saw a prerelease announcement i texted him and i just said look \"i'm really excited to see your book\" and he said \"oh great thank you you know be great if you'd write something like an endorsement\" i said \"oh i'd be honored to i'm happy to\" and he said \"but i need it tonight\" and this was saturday i think it was like 1030 at night when i texted him so it's a great well i'd be happy to i won't do it now he said \"i need it by midnight\" so i sit down and i start writing this thing and these are short blurbs but i kind of realized that you know you wanna get it right it's david and you know my name's next to it and i wanna do do it justice so i'm sitting down i'm working on the saying and i texted him \"look i'm gonna be a few minutes late no problem no problem\" finally i sent him the thing at like 1230 at night and he's like \"aw bro thank you thank you thank you i promise i'll send you a copy of this and that\" and i was like grateful you know thank you and then i realized that that time he was living in new york and i said \"wait a second where are you\" he said \"new york\" and i said \"it's 330 in the morning\" and he goes \"yeah i'm going running\" and i realized at that point i was like okay you know there's it's undisputable you know this guy lives the persona that he projects into the world and even that day that consulting gig you know there was a four o'clock lag and he was like no let's keep going so he's figured something out and i think that his enormous popularity is it's earned because he's figured out that it really doesn't matter if you come at something from a place of joy and love and that would be wonderful but there's a whole other set of ways to approach this that involve slogging through the discomfort the doubts the wish for things to be different and starting with behavior and it's incredible 'cause if you think about sensation perception feeling thought and behavior actually the way to control our nervous system and feel the way we wanna feel is to run that backwards behavior thoughts so if you change your behavior then generally your thoughts your feelings and your perceptions change and everyone tries to come at it from the other end but he's figured out through whatever process led him there and incredible life circumstances how to run it in this direction of behavior first and i really think that if neuroscience has anything to offer it's some understanding of what the underlying chemicals and neurocircuits are but the sooner that the human animal the human species can start to understand that our feelings and our thoughts and our memories and our all that is very complicated but that when behaviors are very concrete and they are the control panel for the rest of it i don't wanna relegate feelings feelings are extremely important i don't wanna relegate perception they're extremely important but when it comes to wanting to shift the way that you function to get better or to perform better or to show up better or to move away from things like addictive behaviors it's absolutely foolish for any of us me included to think that we can do that by changing our thoughts first it's behavior first thoughts feelings and perceptions follow mood follows action mood follows action this is like been my mantra forever and you know i swear by it and david's example illustrates that that act first he's developed so much neuroplasticity that it's reflexive for him to just move towards the hard thing or the challenge or the discomfort right and now the science establishes that this is indeed the case and yet our programming our default hard wiring is to you know put us in this place where we want to ruminate on all this stuff and wait until we feel like doing something before we do it or check our motivations for it but anytime i'm in a funk or i wanna change my state i have to move forward i have to do something with my physical body in order to shake things up and you know rearrange whatever's going on mentally so and it and it works every time it works every time because the brain circuits meaning sets of connections and chemicals they're there from birth they're there your whole life and they were designed for that so in 2018 a graduate student in my lab published a paper in nature showing that in the face of a physical threat there are three options you can obviously freeze you can retreat or you can move forward and the moving forward response actually triggers activation of a connection in the brain to the dopamine circuitry of the brain and makes it more likely that you're gonna be able to move forward in the future now what was interesting to us was that not only is forward action rewarded at a neurochemical level which then sets you up for more forward action but the highest level of agitation and stress was associated with moving forward we always think well if i just call myself enough i'll be able to move forward but it's the exact opposite you know and so people who are paralyzed in fear or that have a hard time initiating sometimes the key is to raise the level of stress and agitation this is why deadlines are so effective this is why fear is so effective this is why that deer gets up out of its you know nice little den and starts to move because it feels a certain level of agitation if that agitation isn't high enough we will not move forward and so especially in the us you know we have a culture in which stress has been created you know these ideas around stress is that it's terrible for us when in fact stress is designed to move us forward towards these action steps that are rewarded which then move us forward and so on so what is the process of combating that you know monkey mind that is you know running whatever narrative that's keeping you stuck like it's easy to say like just move you gotta take the action but a lot of people still despite understanding that intellectualizing that are unable to you know basically act as if yeah i think we're dealing with two general categories of people who have problems with motivation and focus and i think we've failed to decide excuse me i think we failed to describe the fact that there are two groups and not one we think well i need to calm myself enough to move forward i think and then other people say well no you need to kind of ramp yourself up to move forward here's the way i conceptualize it based on the data that i'm aware of some people are just hypo aroused they're just not motivated enough and those people would benefit greatly from cultivating practices like super oxygenated breathing so this is something along the lines of like tummo type breathing so rapid and we look at this and allow we're actually running a human study on this now so 25 or 30 deep breaths through the nose and out through the mouth then exhaling the breath and holding learning to how to self generate adrenaline that's what you're doing when you're doing that some version of the wim hof technique that's what that is brian mckenzie talks about right an ice bath is doing the exact same thing stimulating adrenaline response it actually improves the immune system there's a published paper on this releases adrenaline which buffers the immune system against infection but getting good at taking yourself from low low energy to higher energy and then learning how to compress your focus and i'll talk about the focus thing in a minute some people are so agitated the monkey mind they got too many things going on and they're thinking okay they're trying to sit down and write i suffer from this and i'm feeling like wait i've also got this person i need to connect with and i'm kind of being drawn off course by not being able to put the blinders on for people that have that issue i think learning how to calm the nervous system is very powerful and the best way that i know how to do that is based on two studies one published in nature one published in cell reports recently showing that physiological size there's actually a thing in the literature called physiological size are one of the fastest ways to bring our overall level of sub autonomic arousal down and a physiological sigh is a two inhales followed by an extended exhale so it's like it's not just a deep breath it's two inhales followed by an exhale okay and what that what that does and this has been shown several times now in humans and other species as well is it dilates the little sacks of the lungs and that second inhale dilates them a little bit more and it pulls a little bit of carbon dioxide out of the bloodstream so that when we exhale we offload the maximum amount of carbon dioxide and it perfectly adjust the ratio of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the bloodstream and lungs and sometimes it only takes one of these double inhale exhale sometimes somebody needs to do two or three but that's the fastest way to bring the autonomic nervous system down a lot of people need such a tool because i think we talk a lot about meditation and tools for calm and you know i can go to esalen for a weekend and get a massage i'm gonna feel very good but then when i'm thrown back in real life i need something that's gonna work in real time what i call a real time tool and most people don't know how to control their autonomic nervous system because it's complicated i can't control my liver function i can eat that will calm me but that has complicated you know issues with it too if i'm just eating to calm myself so the diaphragm is the one skeletal muscle organ that was internally right we've got obviously skeletal muscles designed to move things it's a skeletal muscle organ unlike the spleen the liver the heart et cetera it was designed to be moved voluntarily and these physiological size are actually occurring fairly regularly during sleep to adjust our levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen and there's a recent study showing that in claustrophobia this is the breathing pattern that people default to to try and offload that carbon dioxide so whereas there are a lot of really interesting breathing techniques wim hof brian mckenzie does great work patrick mchugh you know the laird and gabby there're tons of people doing really interesting things out there my lab has been focused on what are the neural circuits that are designed to achieve particular states that happen to impinge on and capture diaphragm function and so the reason i think breathing is so powerful is that everyone has a diaphragm and it's the immediate link to the body a lot's been made at the vagus nerve you know oh the vagus is the path between the body and mind but the vagus is very slow the vagus nerve calming is what you experience when you eat a really rich carbohydraterich meal or you've had a long day and you put your feet up and you're finally relaxing it takes minutes to hours to kick in whereas the diaphragm is realtime control over your brain state so the brain knows what the body is doing by how fast the diaphragm is moving it knows its overall activation state so when you breathe quickly those 25 or 30 breaths the brain says oh i must be alert i'm gonna start secreting some noradrenaline and when you breath slowly that level of noradrenaline drops down so it sounds so simple but i think it's only in the last two or three years that my lab and mark krasnow's lab at stanford and other labs elsewhere in the world have started to identify the neurons in the brain that are linked to breathing and how those two things relate to one another and i think everybody should have a kit of tools that they can use to bring themselves down and ramp themselves up i'll just say one other thing about focus so when we're in a high alert state something very powerful happens that i think partially explains your your ability now to drop into this book writing when there's a certain amount of adrenaline in our system our pupils dilate remember the eyes are not connected to the brain our eyes are actually two pieces of central nervous system they are two pieces of brain outside the skull that were designed to control our overall arousal state and so we can talk about this as it relates to sleep and sleep quality but when i bring up the level of adrenaline in my body through breathing or let's say i see a troubling text or let's just say i just use a very gogginstypeapproach and just figure out the most painful inspiring for me reason to do it you know it sounds vague 'cause obviously david i don't know what goes on in your head but a tremendous respect for your ability to do this but he just ratchets himself out of that ditch and puts himself in motion the pupils dilate and when that happens our visual system actually enters something that's a little bit more like portrait mode on our phone there's a process called accommodation and your ability to focus on one thing visually actually becomes better and your ability to see everything else blurs away and that's the ability to just see that screen of text or that if you were work on you know pad and paper to just see that pad and paper and then as you start writing what people don't realize is that mental focus follows visual focus now in blind people it's slightly different it follows auditory focus but in most people your visual focus as you bring that into really sharp relief that image of your book and you stare at you're gonna feel some agitation and your mind's gonna be jumping all over the place but if you wait just a couple minutes the rest of the world will disappear i think this is sort of like the flow state people are looking for but remember the gate of entry is one of which you have to wade through some sewage before you can swim in clear water that's the way i always think about it but the visual focus is what brings the rest of the brain into cognitive focus and people in the martial arts understand this you've probably experienced this running when you're feeling exhausted and you can just concentrate on one milestone and get there you can almost bring that into like you what you're doing is you're linking that to the dopamine circuitry you're saying that thing is the milestone not winning the race not some other thing outside this this immediate environment that thing and when you're able to start capturing these peripheral circuits meaning the body the diaphragm the visual system then you start getting past this whole idea of mindsets and it really becomes about the body setting the mind and this is where i think when you say action leads the rest right it's that's what you're saying is grounded in real neuro biological data there's also a shift in your perception of time when you're in that state you know suddenly your relationship with time becomes completely different so i'm really glad you and i'm not like you know it's easy to say it slows down or it speeds up to me it's neither you're in this weird liminal state where it's almost like it doesn't exist it's not it's not a relevant like vector in your in your emotional experience i'm really glad you brought this up because one of my obsessions is time perception and you know having spent the last 20 years or so studying the visual system what you start to realize is that space meaning physical space not outer space but physical space around you and your time perception are absolutely linked and when our focus is very narrow time starts to feel thin sliced so you're right it's not that it's going fast or slow it's that you're perceiving more events per unit time so it's like a metronome that's going faster when our gaze is dilated so when we're relaxed there's actually a what happens is the pupil kind of relaxes a bit it doesn't always get bigger or smaller but what happens is when we're relaxed so if you view a horizon for instance or you go into what's called panoramic vision so even though i'm looking at you right now i can dilate my gaze without moving my head or eyes so i can see the corners of the room and the ceiling i can see myself in the environment when we do that our perception of time broadens and we feel like we have more time and what we're doing when we do that focus versus defocus as i call it or focal vision versus panoramic vision is you're toggling on and off the autonomic nervous system for alertness you're turning on and off that norepinephrine circuit and so it's conscious control over a brainstem circuit and this is why i don't like the phrase autonomic 'cause that means automatic it's a misnomer all the breathing i can control my autonomic nervous system i can breathe i can control my autonomic nervous system i can eat a big meal i can control my autonomic nervous system i can focus or defocus and if you really look at the realm of highperformance what you start to realize is people who are very good at their respective sport or career or in the special operations community what they do are exceptionally good at turning it on and off these systems so they're highly functional at achieving their milestones but they're not spending out extra energy because when you go into panoramic vision you start to uncouple the space time thing and you get some rest and relaxation the way to think about this as we go back to duration path and outcome that's the most stringent high focus regime for the brain the way to get better at duration path and outcome is to engage in activities that are low duration path and outcome where your brain is not in modes of analyzing duration path and outcome what's the one phase of our life when we're not thinking about duration path and outcome at all sleep and so the reason why you can pull somebody's mind apart their ability to think rationally and analyze duration path and outcome by sleep depriving them is because sleep despite all its neurochemical complexity is really when we restore our ability to analyze duration path and outcome now you think about buds and you go no wonder they're sleep deprived they're trying to figure out who has the ability to control these mechanisms and who doesn't most people fail so when i think about how to recover i've i actually don't think about recovery as its own thing i think about recovery as giving buoyancy or improving my ability to focus so sleep is the turning off of these brain circuits that are thinking about what's happening next so some people experience challenges in falling asleep they need to learn how to turn off thinking and there's actually a way to do this we're doing a study on this now it relates to hypnosis that will be fun to talk about and we can if you like the other thing is that just merely going into panoramic vision say between a meeting instead of looking at your phone more focal vision we're hard on your book maybe you walk to the kitchen just two seconds of what i call deliberate decompression where you just kind of let your mind go broader will allow you to reset your focus much more intensely when you return to that book as opposed to if you'd looked at your phone or engaged even in some other kind of deep duration path outcome type function of the brain so when you start thinking about meditation it's also valuable because a lot of meditation involves focusing on your breath i actually think a lot of people are spending out this ability they're working too hard in the activities that are designed to reset them so the two ways to reset yourself in wakefulness being just very adamant about my meditation practice that's right because it's an it's a letting go it's not it's you know it's we're so programmed to like force ourselves to do things or to like dive in with intentionality but so much of this is more elusive than that i think that we can all do ourselves a great service and perform much better in what we're doing by taking little micro recoveries in the form of dilating our gaze in between meetings just for a second viewing a horizon is the best way to do it because it naturally brings the eyes into defocus we're doing this in vr because we can control the visual environment completely when you go into this defocus mode you turn off that brainstem circuit you're conserving norepinephrine for your next bout of focus in activity otherwise you're spending it and the brain doesn't care how you spend it doesn't care if it's on instagram doesn't care if it's watching the news but learning how to defocus and then refocus very quickly can get you through a race that you wouldn't otherwise have been able to get through it saves you energy and it builds energy the other thing is we talk a lot about sleep and sleep is extremely important but there are other modes of and brain states that can allow you to recover one of the ones that i'm a huge proponent of and that my lab has been studying and other labs are studying is what many people call yoga nidra where you i've done yoga nidra a lot it's a wonderful practice you know just lying down and focusing enough of your attention so that you don't fall asleep and enough of your attentions on and moving it around so that you're not really concentrating on any one thing i fall asleep every time i do too yeah i do too but what we know so i fundamentally disagree with respectfully though with the idea that we can't recover sleep that we've lost because what are we really talking about there for me it's the ability to perform these duration path outcome analysis so in my lab we have people do a cognitive task and then we place them into these very deep states of relaxation through things that are kind of like yoga nidra and people can find yoga nidra scripts out there they're everywhere on youtube elsewhere or we have them do a hypnosis script hypnosis is very similar deep relaxation wandering sort of attention fairly narrow context but it brings the brain into these unique states where you're neither asleep nor awake and for people that have trouble falling asleep or trouble relaxing themselves these kinds of practices are extremely useful because they're really teaching you how to turn off those modes of focus so you know we live in a stress society some people are stressed 'cause they're overwhelmed but other people are stressed because they just don't know how to turn off their brain and fall asleep and so if you wanna learn how to turn off your brain and fall asleep these practices are immensely useful how do you practice hypnosis by yourself though so there's some scripts i would recommend people go to one of the scripts on youtube or there's some good ones i've never met him i don't have any relationship to him but michael sealey sealey an australian guy has some really good hypnosis scripts and they're just audio programs yeah you just listen to them and these and he's not gonna make you walk off a cliff or anything no so stage hypnosis is very different so i have a very close collaboration with a guy named david spiegel who's in our psychiatry department at stanford we're now looking at how daily breathing exercises can impact people's sleep and levels of stress he's done a lot of work on addiction and trauma and pain management through hypnosis and most all of hypnosis that's clinical involves bringing one's state into one of deeper relaxation not full sleep and then thinking about some behavioral change that one wants to make these are ancient practices really and i think that they were developed by people that understood that rewiring of the brain requires focus and deep rest what's interesting about hypnosis is it brings those two things together at the same moment so normally you'll work really hard on something work really hard then you'll sleep and that's when the plasticity occurs but hypnosis likely accelerates that whole process by having people enter a state of deep relaxation and focus at the same time and allows those circuits to reshape themselves and there's some published data from david's lab to support that that's fascinating so i think these practices are really useful and i think that if you wanna get better at performing everyone now knows thanks to matt walker's book and others like \"sleep more sleep better\" but what if you have trouble sleeping well or falling asleep well we want to define what that is some people have a hard time turning off their thoughts it's really hard remember you can't do it what you can do is to learn to control that perceptual window and distribute it so that your sense of time starts to kind of drift off and you end up in sleep more easily and it's a practice that most people find if they do it for 10 minutes a day or so they start sleeping much better within a week or more and sometimes more they sometimes people need some other help like not drinking caffeine late in the day et cetera but that brain state of no duration path and outcome analysis is gonna be the most restorative and you can get it in wakefulness too so taking a walk where you're just letting your mind go is very powerful and the other thing that's powerful is optic flow so selfgenerated optic flow by walking running or cycling shifts the brain into a state of relaxation that's not seen when you're stationary this is welldescribed in the neuroscience literature for some reasons not welldescribed in the wellness literature but it's a real thing when you move through space you're active you're there's a natural calming of the brain circuits involved in threat and threat detection this is the basis for emdr eye movement desensitization reprocessing the lateralized eye movements they have people do in the clinic that on a goofylooking thing while they do counter trauma i've heard you talk about that to overcome fear and trauma that lowers stress and the rationale is that by coupling a low stress state to the recall of the trauma it's gonna allow people to reshape the relationship to the trauma to tolerate that discomfort and it emdr my clinical colleagues tell me works best for fairly welldefined traumas it's not gonna be like my childhood or you know a whole series of events but for single event traumas or trauma that's repeated but of the same sort it seems to work best it's not gonna work best to completely reshape all relationships to all traumas but it does seem to be powerful for a certain group of people so basically an example would be if you got into a car accident and then you're afraid to get in a car or something like that right so you take this person and you submit them to this therapy where they move their eyes back and forth laterally which seems absurd seems goofy right so this is supposed to help them get over their fear or their blockage yeah so okay so my lab studies vision and we study stress and states of mind and people used to talk to me about emdr and asked me about emdr and i was like this is crazy this sounds like a music genre this is absurd right or a drug makes no sense why would moving the eyes from side to side have any impact on states of mind that's ridiculous but then what happened was in 2018 2019 and 2020 five quality manuscripts came out in very good journals from groups that were studying eye movements not studying stress or trauma that found that these lateralized eye movements not up and down but lateralized eye movements quiet the activity of the amygdala the limbic structure in the brain that's primarily responsible for threat detection and stress and i was like oh my goodness this thing might actually be real then i started to dig into the backstory of this and there was a woman named francine shapiro who came up with this idea actually walking behind stanford in the stanford hills she was a therapist and she figured she had this idea based on the fact that she didn't feel as upset about certain things when she was walking that this might be useful and she was smart enough to know that these lateralized eye movements are what reflexively occur anytime we're in optic flow we don't realize it 'cause they're subconsciously generated and they're very subtle but she realized she couldn't really take people walking on their therapy sessions i suppose she could but it's not really practical it's raining et cetera so what she decided to do was to bring the eye movement component to the clinic and have them move their eyes from side to side while they would recount these traumas and people experienced tremendous benefit and in fact now there's a lot of evidence to show that these lateralized eye movements really do quiet the stress of the nervous system and allow people to continue to move forward this is probably all anchored i go back to that story of that deer that needs something and as it's feeling that agitation and gets up and starts moving the movement feeds back onto the brain to quiet that stress and anxiety so it can be observant of its environment and that panoramic mode is what we are in when we are in a position to be very situationally aware when we're stressed we are gonna have you know soda straw view of the world right this relates directly to addiction because i've spent some time at addition treatment clinics and talking to people in that community and it's very clear that of course there are a huge number of factors that play into why people become addicted and relapse et cetera but if you can get at people's ability to control their anxiety and their feelings of peak states and happiness you don't guarantee but you help reinforce the possibility that they're gonna get sober and stay sober as an addict gets more tethered to the idea that some substances the thing they need the progressive narrowing of the things that bring them pleasure and everything else kind of falls away like portrait mode on the phone they're essentially in a state of high stress trying to meet that dopamine need all the time and they don't see other possibilities the reason i mentioned not just stress and treating stress to get at addiction but also pleasure is that we've also seen this when do people relapse when they're feeling really good when they're feeling really lousy and stressed and when they're feeling really good they've been sober for five years we hear about this in the news usually from celebrity examples people have been doing great all of a sudden they're back in treatment and you're like what happened what happened was the dopamine circuit from other things maybe a great life event or things are going well or stress the loss of a job everything crashing puts our visual system and the rest of our brain into a myopia we become near we literally become nearsighted and the dopamine system says that's the only thing that's gonna get me out of the mode that i'm in they literally don't see the other possibilities so some of the work that i'm starting to get involved in now is to try and inform the addiction treatment community the trauma community that there are ways to use action in the body to move people out of states of myopia nearsightedness and this is kind of a cognitive nearsightedness and allow them to start pursing their time perception differently it hard you know it goes right back to time perception when an addict needs something their sense of time is fixed to the retrieval of that thing or the you know reaching that thing and then when they can dilate their sense of time they realize they have time for other options but until you can dilate that there's really no chance frankly you can't find a way in you can't find a way you can tell somebody you're gonna lose your kids and they'll do it anyway and that just tells us we need another route to it and so one of the things i think is powerful is to think about how can we leverage the visual system how can we leverage the diaphragm system in the same way that you would tell a you know somebody who's in you know has cancer or needs a surgery of a certain sort like we need to leverage certain technologies well we need to leverage certain inborn technologies of respiration and vision to be able to access states of mind that will allow us to make better choices for the addict in that really nearsighted view fixated there is no other choice and i think those early years of skateboarding and being you know feral it showed me that these the people i knew that became addicts and frankly i know some adults who have become addicts even who have very quoteunquote functional lives it wasn't just them those people you know we like to think they're making a bad choice and they had they're making a bad decision it's unclear to me whether or not they have a choice in those highly myopic states of mind and so what we need to do is we need to dilate their perception of the world around them we need to dilate their perception of time we need to learn they need to learn how to relax themselves so they can actually see other options and it all relates to how the visual system and the breathing system relate to autonomic function addiction is the perfect sort of laboratory to do this and it's so important i think because if it were simply the case that people just needed family support and which they do and they needed you know encouragement and they need discouragement about making the wrong behaviors then this we wouldn't even be having this discussion it's so much more complicated than that it's so much more complicated i mean the thing i think all of those are you know really powerful tools and important things to look at with respect to the addict mentality or that disposition there has to be a level of selfawareness in that addict that the decision to pick up the drink or to use the drug begins so far in advance of the actual behavior by the time they actually pick up that drink there's no getting in the way of that like that decision has so much momentum behind it that it's almost impossible to reverse so a breathing technique or any technique at that juncture is unlikely to be successful so it's about recognizing you know when that state is starting to shift in that direction whether it's days or hours or weeks before the behavior choice to intervene at a place in time when you can actually have an impact i agree i think that it's always an uphill battle with addiction at least at first but even just given that the numbers on relapse you know i think every what was it that someone wants told me i don't know if this is actually true but for most people but he said a recovered addict told me you know he that everyday he tells himself no matter how far i drive i'm always the same distance from the ditch you know i mean the addiction community has there's so many awesome there's so many great takeaways yeah what's interesting is there's a some verbiage around the yoga community that is very valuable i can't recall it off the top of my head but they talk about the great support that one can get from learning to access brain states of timelessness sleep being very restorative wakeful deliberate disengagement being very restorative maybe meditation maybe through yoga nidra maybe through simple quick breathing techniques but being able to dilate and contract one sense of time and not being locked to one kind of spacetime regime the ability to recognize that i'm not seeing clearly or i see what i see but i don't know what i don't see the ability to introduce that understanding for somebody can be very powerful and i think we need to give them tools that they can look to very quickly i don't think we're ever gonna have a treatment for addiction that's in the form of a pharmaceutical like one pill because if you start tapping into the dopamine system itself you start degrading other aspects of life so i think one of the reasons why addiction treatment is so complicated is that you need many elements but the elements that come from the person themselves are ultimately the most important ones of course and i think physiology and neuroscience does have some tools that can lend support to that yeah yeah it's interesting i mean i think that every couple of years you see new science emerge on addiction and there's some new protocol and you know 12 steps constantly getting thrown under the bus and you know 12 steps what got me sober and i'm very rooted in that community i remain open to other you know modalities and protocols and super interested in seeing where all of this is going but i think it is important to appreciate how complex it is like there's a trauma element to it there's a you know behavioral modification element to it there's an emotional like how do you how do you find a way to anchor this person to a path a life path that has meaning and purpose and all of these things inform this complex you know soup that's going on in their head that's dictating whether they're gonna pick up a drink or not yeah and you know and i love the neuroscience community with you know it's been my family and home for many years now and the people working on addiction are you know motivated from the right place and they are you know working exceedingly hard there are a lot of data now that show you know for instance there are complete genetic changes in the cells that can you know and the pathways that control dopamine and reward and that's all wonderful to understand but meanwhile i think there are enough tools out there that they need to be aggregated in a way that's structured and that addiction treatment communities can leverage one of the things that would be of great use is the idea of a biomarker so you described that you know and it's really a beautiful example of how when some early on you might be able to intervene but later it gets much harder we need biomarkers that are gonna tell us for some people or their family that somebody is at risk some of you have biomarkers some kind of whooped device right well i think it's gonna come from once you know how well somebody is regulating their own autonomic nervous system you can predict pretty well whether or not they're going to succeed or fail in making good decisions and so i do think a whoop type device or other sensor device could be tremendously beneficial in detecting and telling people whether or not they are veering off course right and i think it's getting very minority report though it is i mean i think machines are gonna help us make a lot of decisions that we're actually pretty poor at making but the simplest of those that we might see in the next two or three years is saying look you've been working extremely hard on your book you're doing very well but you're gonna need an extra hour of sleep i mean that's essentially what it's doing for you or in 12 hours you're gonna make a bad decision in 12 hours you're gonna make a bad decision or even cuing it or insert might in there right you might make a bad decision so that you're more aware and you're gonna devote a little more mental energy to the kinds of decisions you're making i think that as i pull a lot of all nighters and i still do unfortunately in my career writing grants and so forth and i have this rule that i learned my gosh about 15 years ago which is i don't trust any of my thinking that occurs between 300 am and 700 am if i've been up all night i just don't trust it because i start to think the world's falling apart i start thinking the word the is misspelled i mean i really know i'm sleep deprived when words like the look misspelled and then i'm like what's going on that's that duration path outcomes circuitry starting to try and starting to fall apart so i think that that's an extreme example but i think that short of having people buffer their lives with tons of activities and perfect nutrition and perfect social interactions people learning to control their autonomic nervous system i think is really the next step in our species evolution i really believe that what we are seeing now in the world is a call to arms if you will or a request from mother nature to have everybody learn how to control their autonomic nervous system a little bit better or ideally a lot better yeah it's absolutely critical i think i mean right now you know irrespective of what's going on with the pandemic and the political climate and the protests and all the upheaval that we're seeing as a culture we're experiencing an extraordinary poverty of attention and focus we're so distracted by our devices we're more anxious and stressed and depressed than we ever have been before this is not going in a good direction and to the extent that we can commandeer a little bit more control over these things and understand that we have some level of agency and we can reverse this sort of automatic pattern that we're on of just scrolling endlessly and you know doing what we're doing that we know is not leading us in a good direction is critical if we're gonna find our way forward and to speak a little bit to what's going on right now i think you know and it's related and i'm interested in your thoughts on you know the neuroscience that is you know i think relevant to this is that we've lost the ability to have civil discourse there's a real breakdown in communication right now culturally and socially and it's fractured our society and it's not good right so what is going on neurologically with human beings that are attaching themselves and it's so self identifying with certain narratives that it's polarizing our population and preventing us from being able to just be together or united or agree upon what is true and what is not true and share a value system so that we can see our way through the challenges that we're facing right now which many of which are an existential threat to the future of humanity and the planet it's a huge problem you articulated it beautifully and i think neuroscience can offer a couple of insights into why it's happening and perhaps what we might do about it so one of the scientific results that i'm very intrigued by is in the 1960s a guy named robert heath recorded from the human brain there are people you can't do this experiment nowadays but skull popped off my neurosurgery friends tell me that's no big deal electrodes lower deep into the brain all over the brain and people can stimulate wherever they want and they just report what they're feeling so press one lever they feel drunk they press another lever they feel happy they press another lever they feel sexually aroused and they're reporting all of this right when was this done in the 1960s the early 1960s several times actually and published twice essentially the same data different populations in the journal science which is sort of our super bowl science and nature cell those are the big ones journals rep that is so the number one brain area that people want to stimulate they finally hit this lever where they go oh i like that and they just keep hitting that thing and hitting that thing and hitting that thing frustration and mild anger and i saw that result that's the choice i could be drunk i could be happy i could be i'm gonna choose frustration and anger exactly it's what that told us is it's clearly tapped into the dopamine reward system it feels like a hit of dopamine to them more than anything else so we need to put that on the shelf and keep it visible as we kind of march into this sort of answer to your question the other thing is an understanding that and there's some recent data on this that are really impressive not from my lab but from another lab which is that beliefs and information that supports our prior beliefs also increases the activity of these reward systems so the more i see stuff that verifies what i already think or feel that they are bad and they are good or that we are good and they are bad the more dopamine and adrenaline is released into my system which we now know from our discussion a few minutes ago changes the way i view the world it actually changes the way i view the world it means that i'm gonna see certain things and not see others and this also relates to the auditory system i'm gonna hear certain things and not hear others the things that verify my beliefs are i'm gonna feel rewarded for the things that are counter to my beliefs i'm not gonna be it's rewarded for so we have all these barricades to empathy and to really listening and to really hearing what the other side is trying to say and we have all these support networks in our body and our brain which are building a bigger and bigger divide now that's all very depressing so the question is what's the boat that's gonna get us across that divide and i believe and i am not just defaulting to this 'cause it's what my lab works on but i fundamentally believe that the boat that's gonna get us to the other side is our ability to control our internal state to be able to ratchet down our level of autonomic arousal just enough so that i can dilate not just my vision of what's happening in my immediate environment but i can dilate my cognition my thinking to the possibility that there may be a kernel of value in what somebody else is saying even if it's about me and i don't like what i'm hearing now as somebody who spent time in the addiction treatment community you probably know this is a lot of what you get good at as you learn to move through something that to you feels very good and you know all the reasons why it would probably be good to change it but you know what you don't want to because it feels so good so we're talking about an addiction to entrenched thinking we're talking about an addiction and neurochemical systems that support lack of change my refusal to change and stubbornness and i actually think just like in for the treatment of addiction and trauma the key is to get people to learn to tolerate progressively higher levels of stress and maintain dilation of sensory experience of thought experience we've got to create some small little portals through which information can come in a lot's been made of mirror neurons i hate to break it to the crowd but the data in support of mirror neurons in humans is not that impressive and now the mirror neuron people are gonna come after me but fine there are circuits in the brain that control emotional contagion and those are what's powerful my ability to recruit you into stress is much more powerful than my ability to recruit you into empathy for something good that's a wellestablished neurobiological fact or empathy for someone's perspective that you know that i'm fundamentally going to disagree with right so i think there are three gates to getting there and by there i think we're you know i'm referring vaguely to the idea that we need to increase our level of understanding at least our level of discourse so that we can hear other really hear other people's ideas even though we don't like the way it feels and we love the way that we feel this is one of the results so we love the way we feel we don't like the way other people feel the first thing is to bring the level of urgency that we feel internally down we need to learn to calm ourselves in order to really have the information start to come in now the system right now and people out there everyone's in a frenzy and you can see it our collect the collective consciousness is kind of losing its mind it's kind of out of its mind we need to learn how to turn off those amygdala circuits so are we all gonna get together and do emdr probably not are we all gonna get together and do breathing exercises probably not not at scale what we need to do is start to figure out how we can i think especially for the next generation of kids how to teach them to regulate their nervous system so that they recognize that pulse of adrenaline as placing them in a compromised position like we have to leverage the idea that being able to hear and listen hinges on the ability to be calm so therefore the ability to be calm is crucial to hearing and listening and hearing and listening is crucial to our advancement as individuals and as groups the problem is everyone's been trying to do this backwards they've said we all have to get along we have to cancel cancel culture we all have to you know listen to one another and i think again we have to start from the inside we have to teach it physiologically now i don't have a master plan on how to do that but one of the reasons i'm here and one of the reasons i'm teaching neuroscience on instagram and not just in my laboratory is until we can learn to regulate the self i don't think we're gonna get where we wanna go as a culture i think it really does start with our own individual ability to do that and so you know david's a really good example for instance of somebody who learn how to deal with his own internal mess and build something beautiful out of that and he continues to do that and everyone's got to find that process for themselves and whether or not you have a perfect family or whether or not you consider yourself the most inclusive and accepting person in the world or not everyone needs to learn how to do that for themselves and everyone thinks we do it pretty well but i think it's clear that none of us do it well enough so autonomic arousal autonomic arousal autonomic control i think those are the entry points for addiction for trauma and for really impact that hearing and listening and until we do that i think our species is gonna continue to go around this merrygoround where every 50 or a hundred years we crash right up against the same general set of issues only now social media has made it slightly more or a lot more complicated it's a little bit similar to what you were talking about in terms of the seeking external validation versus finding it within yourself like essentially the protocol the prescription that you just gave has a strain of buddhism in it in the sense that the world's gonna change when we change ourselves like the best most impactful way that you can make a difference for the world is to focus on being the best version of yourself how can you comport yourself in a way that allows you to be more receptive and objective and empathetic and able to listen and hear and i think that's true it's a hundred percent true and then i think about the person losing their shit and you know target or whatever over the masks or whatever you know insane video clip of the day i happened to see on social media and i think we're doomed like is this person gonna do that no i can't control that i can only control myself and i worry that when the onus is on the individual to solve the problem that that we're not gonna find our way through it right like we obviously need organizational institutional and systemic changes we need to change the way these social media platforms work the way in which we're delivered information and the way in which we're siloed but i don't have any control over any of those things the only thing i have control over is my own internal mechanism so what other choice do we have well i think we need people in positions of power and leadership who are very good at internal control you know i think emotions are great i experienced them often intensely but congratulations thank you they're not always wonderful to experience but i think it's clear that the level of autonomic arousal that's associated with emotion's either very high or very low very happy or very sad very anxious or very angry clouds our judgment it's very clear and i think the sooner we give them too much credence too they're just feelings man like we don't have to allow them to overtake us and monopolize everything that we do they were designed to push us along certain behavioral paths but they've grown in importance in the last few years and you know we could get into a discussion about how you know social media marketing are designed to capture these very deep limbic aspects of ourselves and they are but what's amazing is and important is that everybody has a forebrain some people it seems it's more developed than others but everybody has one and we have this capacity for what we call top down control which is the ability to intervene in our own feeling states and our own action states and to set some rigor and some real clear marks that we're out to achieve and i think it's gonna start with the generation that's very plastic right now you know most parents are afraid of stressing their kids because they don't wanna you know again i went to a high school where kids literally at gunn high school in the last 10 years kids have you know there've been over a dozen you know train track suicides so those are kids that are committing suicide for different reasons but a lot of them is 'cause they just feel too much pressure so obviously we can't you know we can't pressure kids beyond their capacity to regulate but the idea that all of our internal state should be driven by external things that's a foolish misstep also so i think we need to operationalize what we're gonna teach the next generation you know maybe our generation isn't really rescueable but maybe the next generation is and if they understand that there's some concepts that sound a little mushy like gratitude or mindfulness or these kinds of things but as long as they understand that for instance gratitude which we didn't really touch on involves a whole other neurotransmitter reward system in the brain the serotonin system which buffers us against injury it can improve wound repair it can allow us to lean back into these high stress regimes learning and kids learning how to toggle their nervous system back and forth between highly you know duration path outcome focus states of trying to improve and learn and then learning how to really relax and chill out and enjoy and be socially connected because it will allow them to ratchet back in and focus with extreme depth i think in doing that we might not get every child to learn how to do that but if we can distribute that information widely enough and there's so many brilliant examples and beautiful example yours david's many others of people that have been able to tap into those systems intuitively if we can get that information out there i really believe that at least a subset of those kids will grow up to be the leaders that our species really needs in order to get through this next filter and right now we're feeling the stringency of that filter and i think our level of autonomic dysregulation as a species the fact that we're there we're here right now says okay here's the task are you guys gonna figure yourselves out you got this forebrain my dog doesn't have the forebrain i've got he can't figure it out but we can work this out and it'll involve technologies like devices to measure how we're doing maybe some machines to guide that that's a different discussion but i think it's entirely possible and i think that's the evolutionary pressure that we're in right now and i think that the next generation if they can hear about it and learn about it is gonna meet that demand our species has done it for every other demand i toggle back and forth between extreme optimism and you know dystopian despair because on the one hand you know you described the experience of going to therapy and you know how that was kind of you know novel at that time but we're not in that place anymore and everybody's got a smartphone and there's you know head space and calm and waking up and all these incredible apps and mindfulness is part of the mainstream modern vernacular like these kids are growing up not only aware of these practices but amenable and you know they're it's being done in the households in which they're being raised which i find to be you know that's an amazing thing i think there is a consciousness that is emerging out of these young people that hopefully you know we can rely on to solve some of these problems and then you know i just think about the endless scrolling and the associated you know i'm just like oh yes we're fucked well i think it's clear that most people young or old are content to be passive consumers and spend out their dopamine doing essentially meaningless activities and consuming food and consuming air and light that is basically damaging to themselves and they i don't think they care i think there are species let's be fair our species is nonessential well no no i didn't say that our species although sometimes i think it'd be interesting if some other species ran the earth but we're the curators of the planet so i think that our species is probably divided into those that are really going to try and maximize on this gift of neuroplasticity right we're the only species that has neuroplasticity throughout the lifespan and that neuroplasticity in childhood lasts as long as it does as a function of our total lifespan it's incredible so we were gifted this and i think some people leverage it and take advantage of it and other people don't and i think we need to accept that we're not gonna get everybody but what we need to do is attach the reward systems of society financial socioeconomic et cetera to the kinds of behaviors that are is gonna give rise to people that can lead us into the next hundred years 200 years now that is not saying oh do away with monetary systems actually the opposite i think that once people start to realize that you're high performing military elite military your high performing athlete your high performing academics you're highperforming business people they actually have practices that they use to regulate themselves to in order to not just perform better but sleep better and not just to sleep better but to listen better not just listen better but incorporate ideas that allow them into states of creativity and states of mind that really lead to new and exciting ways that humans can interact and the many people will just be consumers of everything they produce well all of the what's what's great about new media is that we've democratized access to this information and we're able to realize that these people are not just freaks of nature but that they have a methodology and they've created this canon this tool kit and these practices are available to everybody and you have people like david who are explaining this in very plain terms that it is within your power to take advantage of these things to take better control of your life and we've never seen anything like that before in the history of humanity and i think that that you know that bodes well for the empowerment of the next generation as well i do too i as you can probably tell i'm optimistic i have to be because otherwise i can't justify the work that we're doing but i think that there's so much interest now in psychology and the brain and the self in physical fitness which you know i think it's fair to say is inextricably linked to mental fitness and the fact that people are so curious about what other people are doing and what are the paths to success and you know what are the resources for trauma and addiction i think there's been a kind of swarm of information it's been hard to sort through but i think 2020 is our you know is our sort of call i keep calling it a call to arms and i 'cause i guess i do feel that way it's very serious this is serious business and this is the time for us and the next generation to step up and you know and to lead people toward a place where we can function better and where the next generation will reflexively function better that's that beauty of early childhood is that if some of this stuff is taught and passed off it's not gonna be perfect but there'll be a generation of people coming up that will naturally understand stress and agitation is taking them off their game and leading to bad decisions and will make the appropriate adjustments and there are people that will that read david's book and your book and we'll see the possibility of doing something differently with a terrible childhood or a brutal addiction and you know i think we need more stories of success i think it's easy to look out there and see all the things that are going wrong and we need to keep paying attention to those but we need these beacons that draw people forward and i say that from a place of experience i mean i used to have to find it in books in the bookshelf i there was no online back then or in mentors and you know you have to forage you know i think kids they have to have that foraging capacity they can't just sit there and wait for it to rain on them or for a parent to dump it on them but i trust that they're out there and that they're gonna figure it out just like you're doing on instagram you're dropping these videos basically every day right like more or less little lessons on neuroscience i'm trying i'm trying to show people that i have a kind of no acronym rule so i don't like embedding things in a lot of complex language sometimes i have to use an acronym but yeah teach people a little bit about how their brain works how it interfaces with psychology everyone's got different goals and purposes in the world but you know that scientists are normal people and that hopefully science has something i think really science has something to offer but it's not gonna happen if i'm vaulted in my lab where my papers are read by the 12 people that care enough to read the papers start to finish so i'm doing it there are others out there of course david st clair is doing it  doing it i'm trying to recruit more people from the scientific community to do this i think it's our responsibility you paid for it it's your tax dollars you know there's a tremendous cost to doing science that is not often discussed but i don't really consider it an option i consider it my obligation and i'm gonna keep going well keep doing it man i appreciate the work that you're doing i think it's really important work we need it now more than ever and it's cool that you're getting out there and sharing your wisdom with everybody it's super empowering so thanks man appreciate it thank you really appreciate the chance to be here if you're digging on andrew best way to find him is huberman lab instagram yeah huberman lab huberman lab cool all right man coming back i made all these notes all this stuff i wanted to talk to you about we got through like 10 of it so come by and

completely forgot it's been a while since i've hosted yeah i'm your host for today gant and with me are as usual the boys and today we have a very special guest now in case there is one person in youtube who don't doesn't know who you are do you want to introduce yourself and uh what you do oh my god that's a lot of pressure uh uh my name is anthony padilla some people say padilla i'm totally fine with that but i do like to say padilla like tortilla um that's how i get people to memorize it um let's see so i god how deep do we want to go into this history here youtube okay let's get deep guys uh so i started uh with my friend ian i started a youtube channel called smosh in 2005 17 what's smosh 17 years half of my age ago oh my god jesus half of my age half your life has been on half of my life yes oh  i'm having to rethink so many i'm gonna need that two and a half hours yeah uh and then in 2017 i kind of split off to do my own thing been doing an independent channel which has slowly evolved into me kind of doing deep dive interviews with either groups of people or one person that has um you know some kind of popularity surrounding them right we get we we drill in deep into uh the psychology behind uh blowing up or you know if it's a group of people um i like to kind of get in there and understand them yeah i feel like so many people have preconceived ideas about what a group or what a label or identity means so i like to kind of show that there is variation in nuance from individual to individual yeah they're really good yeah thank you i mean this is like pretty intimidating because not only are you like the og of youtube like i can say that you're you're like you are not even like it's not even like a subjective yeah yeah you're objectively you are you are the og of youtube but also you are like now the interviewer of like youtubers and now we're interviewing you so i'm like first engineer my stuff is so different when i came here i was like so what are we talking about today you're like i don't know when i go into mine i'm like okay okay i've got like this 45 bullet points i know where to get through these i i over plan so much this is just my favorite stuff is always the stuff that comes out of stuff that happens in the moment that was never planned and that is your whole job it's your whole show yeah yeah on youtube it'll say top moment all of it yeah yeah all over cause kind of hit me when you came and you were like so what are we talking about today guys and we just look at each other and we were just like what do you mean oh  we're talking to uh anthony today  he's the interviewer and we don't have any interview questions i was like uh do they have some kind of secret thing that they're not telling me some kind of prank that they're gonna do they're like should we tell them no we're gonna hit you with a low blow in about 30 minutes let's grill me yeah it's actually i've always wanted how much how much prep do you do for your interviews because as we've just established we do zero crap here the only the only prepping we do is who are we getting today yeah um let's see so the shows start i call it i spent a day with whatever the topic or whatever the person's name is and at first it was like four people i would sit down with and it would amount to like eight hours now it's a little bit shorter like two to three hours if it's just one guest a little bit longer but i do a preinterview call which is like an hour hour and a half or two and then i work backwards to try to figure out what we're going to talk what questions i'm going to come up with based on the things that we talked about so yeah god i cannot even question it's a lot of pressure yeah what made you start doing preinterviews is it because you maybe had some guests somewhere you're like  i could have done a way better job like a little bit of that it was also uh bringing on guests that have really big stories and i felt like i couldn't just go in there and be like so um tell me about your childhood and then just like did they just go and i'm like i think they probably got everything like i i also i realized that in the interviews i was cutting out a lot of stuff right right you know i was like it's a lot of me trying to figure out where this is going i kind of want to have an idea of where we're going first yeah and i realized uh that i was like every night before the the next day was an interview i would be like up until 4am like 12 hours straight like  i don't know what i'm talking about i got to learn every single thing about this person's life like drill down you know i interviewed youtubers that's actually how i found out about this podcast i saw that you had interviewed some a v tuber as well oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly um and i like i watched that episode and then i was like learning everything about youtubers i was like wait i could just talk to them have them tell me the important things and then i could reverse engineer the questions based on the conversations that they want to have yeah so basically you you take out some of the research time where you don't even know if you're going down like the wrong rabbit horse yes and instead you just come straight from the source i guess yes yeah and then i'm able to use the extra time that i now have during the interviews to uh kind of drill in deeper to like um like this the psychology behind the feelings that they were having and what things affected them from those moments and how they affect them now yeah and i guess it just allows me to get a little bit deeper with the conversations yeah so like yeah so like the interviews are like 20 to 40 minutes how much of that is like how much source like footage do you have how much of it gets cut out you reckon yeah uh so it depends the person uh markiplier we shot like two hours and 40 minutes and we cut it down to a half hour somehow miraculously after it came out he was like holy  you did it you bastard but uh we apparently like were able to get all the the key components the conversations that were really meaty have them in there while cutting out all the fluff and it's it's a it's a lot of there's a big process that we have uh we have five editors now it goes it goes from person a per they all have like a very specific uh they're like a specific cog in the machine yeah and uh it's a lot of just like grinding it down it goes to the first person they get the full two and a half hours of footage they cut it down to 50 and then it's like that person takes and cuts it down and each person is like really good at refining we just have a oneman machine yeah yeah he's like he works like 10 people's work i'll do it myself yeah damn i do have a solution to that problem you know if you if you're like coming in with like two and a half hours of footage and uh having a hard time cutting it down oh yeah have you ever thought about this thing called a podcast you mean just releasing it all right i never thought about no cuts i have thought about that and people have asked they're like come on just release the full thing i know you got it there somewhere uh but i feel like i'm too much of a stickler for like i want it to really be polished i want everything that i come out with to feel polished and i know that i know there's an environment where people want longer conversations that are unedited like this one obviously has a huge audience even on youtube where i feel like people are not generally looking for very long uncut things you guys found that audience does exist yeah but i just i really want something that feels a little bit more a little bit more bitesized but you could like take those like cut parts that you cut out for example turn it into like a compilation release it on like patreon for like behind the scenes oh yeah yeah have you thought about doing that for sure yeah we definitely have a bunch of like archived conversations that we are noting this didn't really make the cut yeah it is still a strong conversation i mean with with the amount of questions i guess you're asking and the amount of people you're asking i'm sure there's moments there you're like that question didn't go down great oh that that was a little awkward let's just cut that out let's just a little bit but some well it depends sometimes the awkward questions and answers have like yeah are the best ones because it force it puts me on the spot to come up with something that was unplanned and i uh i overthink everything that i usually do that it's the unplanned stuff that actually gets the like gets out of my head because i'm actually you know there in the moment yeah uh but yeah sometimes it's i just move right on yeah you're like all right next question sometimes it'll keep me in keep keep it in of me being like uh so anyway uh me not knowing where to go with it like when i interviewed dominatrixes and some of the details that they said yeah uh i didn't i don't think there was any response that would have felt appropriate in that moment right about some of the actions that went down behind the scenes yeah i think i'm a little too vanilla to have uh been prepared for yeah is there a lot you have to cut out to let's say keep within youtube guidelines i mean to a certain degree yes sometimes we just censor it and that's enough yeah because we don't want the video to be age gated and yeah no one sees this video right um i mean certain episodes yeah i spent a day with strippers i spent yeah matrixes you i mean i'm gonna have an upcoming episode i spent a day with pony players look it up actually or maybe not maybe with us private maybe with a private browser incognito window what is a pony player so they are people that uh it's basically role play it's a little bit of uh dom and sub dynamic and they dress up as a pony kind of in a leather like like my little pony or uh like or just like an actual pony think about a humanoid oh here we go we got we got some visuals for you can you click on that black and white one there i think that one's a pretty good dynamic yeah let's let's let's zoom in on twitter oh uh let's take a look oh wow yeah we don't put these off it's like uh it's like a leather furry a little bit um except it's bdsm so it's not a furry because those are not always associated with anything sexually who's scouting this stuff for you uh yeah i mean a little bit yeah it's uh my producer elise she's like uh so we got this uh really interesting person she has a um an arena you know where horses usually um reside in but it's for the pony players do you want to do you want to add on a little segment where you go on location i was like yeah let's do it i didn't know how to react to that but the obvious answer is yes right yeah it's the context you have to i mean yeah when i when i do a lot of episodes i spend it with dominatrixes i'm like you have to dominate me like that's hard that's power into this but you have to have to journalistic integrity so many comments are like clearly anthony just wanted to know what this was like or like clearly anthony's a pro at this because he didn't really have that big of a reaction i was like i i mean you know transparently i just wanted it's part i wanted to learn about dominatrix isn't the scene i have to put myself in it to really understand of course the dynamic of why people would do this what do they take out of it yeah what do they like about it yeah how do you how do you battle the inner embarrassment you know it's the weirdest thing when it's when it's on camera and it's it feels like it's for research purposes literally yeah to the point where and part of the humor and entertainment comes from me being embarrassed which makes me less embarrassed yeah i guess that makes sense yeah i do videos in japan similar thing yeah i worked in a strip club recently yeah yeah i i did not see that one specifically okay are the strip clubs that are different ah yeah a little bit i guess i mean i haven't been to any here oh oh you should tell me for research research processes yeah i mean that i i feel like yeah when you're on camera it kind of gives you like a free pass to just yes embarrassment yeah not good i realized that the other day i went to this uh this bar i never there's there's this social anxiety that's just like uh uh immediately like cut off any opportunity to to feel like out of my element yeah right so i went to this thing i was like i'm just gonna push myself to do and i was like why i was thinking i was like i could totally do this if cameras were on me and if it was like i'm like talking to the camera i'm gonna be going this thing i'm gonna be uncomfortable let's see what happens yeah i would be able to totally do it yeah and i was trying to reframe my mind to be like can i trick myself into there is a camera following me and i'm doing this for research purposes because i would be a pro i would be a pro with anything invisible it's my invincibility i'm like i could do anything if a camera is on me i don't know it's weird tell me you're a youtuber yeah you're just like concentrated like through influencers it empowers you it feels like you have like a pass to just do it yeah yeah yeah like oh no don't worry he has a camera on him like if these cameras were not rolling and we were all just sat down up there i feel like it might have taken us an extra 10 minutes to warm up you know it's weird right there's like you this feel from being on camera yeah because like normally like most my content is not on camera and the only time i started going on camera was like for this podcast and like at first i was like really really awkward and it was just really really weird being there but then you kind of get used to it and it kind of becomes your friend right and it kind of becomes like it'd be kind of parasocial it becomes like you're amazing you're the audience oh no the camera the camera comes like coming comes like the get out of jail free card you wouldn't normally do that's true because part of the entertainment factor comes from whatever happens yeah yeah yeah so you're forced to lean into this yeah and people around you as well as soon as they see you being being filmed they're like yeah okay they could they can be a bit of a monkey absolutely get a free pass i'll tell you what is like the real free pass though so you sometimes in japan we have like we bring like the camera crew but for some reason every time we've brought like a boom mic that is that is when like people around us know that shit's going down because they they you know they see like a shotgun mic yeah yeah they're like oh well you know this is just like a hobby for someone you know just filming for their friends but when they see a massive boom like they're like oh this is real  right here like this is like yeah they got a crew excuse me gentlemen do you want some coffee they immediately think we're like more important than we actually are when they see the boom yeah we don't even use it most of we just use lapel microphones yeah yeah yeah it's just like a relaxed man yeah free card uh but i i was thinking back to i was like there were there have definitely been moments of things that i've shot that i would be so embarrassed if the cameras weren't rolling and i uh i did this video i spent a day with anime cafe maids uh yes uh i i said if this video gets over 100 000 likes i will become a maid and i will make a documentary about me doing a show and i actually put it on put the show on with the girls that i had interviewed yeah and i look back at that and i i had the most confidence in the world like zero bit of embarrassment about literally stepping on people and having my fullon ass cheeks out yeah so i was like if the cameras were not rolling i would have been like i don't want this attention yeah it was something something about the uh knowing the cameras are there and i'm trying to you know almost like i'm working like i'm  working here guys like something about that i was just like it's okay yeah it's like it's like a little devil that's sitting on your shoulder like don't worry it's for content i don't know if that's a good thing i don't know if that's a good thing just like a professional through and through you know it's it's like you know when you're an actor and the director says like you know  yeah what did they say again you need action know this i'm sorry okay i'm sorry it's only been five days in la okay i i feel like like when i go into a lot of the videos i'm like i will never get a chance to do this again like you can't make it true yeah like you could do the video again but you can't really no no it will never be the same reaction no one's gonna click it again or they will but you know it's not the same it's not the same i i was having a conversation um with someone recently and i was trying to figure out why i feel like i'm in such a different head space when i'm conducting an interview right part of it is that i've done a precall part of it is that i know where the conversation's going to go to a certain degree but also in many ways i feel like it might be it's like the last conversation i'll ever have with this person not to say that like i'll never talk to them or or whatever again but for some reason there is like this is this one moment yeah in a way it feels like there's all this count yeah yeah and even though there's a lot of pressure it for some reason the fact that it feels so dire it almost alleviates the pressure in a weird way right yeah knowing that you can kind of go for this the deep questions and yeah yeah yeah like this is your one shot yeah like what you were saying right right yeah that's awesome when you started did you ever feel like i guess nervous being too intrusive or you know kind of like diving down a bit too deep yeah a little bit i mean i would tell people beforehand like if there's any question that you don't want to answer like don't ever feel like i'm trying to pry further than you're comfortable yeah like i would tell them like tell me to not if yeah going down in direction that you're not comfortable with but now that i do the precalls again that that removes most of yeah sometimes i'll drill down a little bit further but for the most part i see if they're comfortable and i try to word the questions in a way where they can tell me as much as they want or go in as much as they want yeah sometimes they'll tell me something if i want to get in deeper i'll be like oh and i'll kind of rephrase what they just said to me yeah which sounds really stupid if you like if we just leave it in it's me saying the exact same thing that they said but for some reason hearing it back i feel like they know that i understood and then it gives them the opportunity to to refine or dig in deeper if they want yeah so usually it's like i kind of throw out little invitations to go deeper without feeling like i'm prying in okay right right so it's like it's like their choice if they would like to go down if they want to yes yes right exactly that's pretty smart to do yeah sounded like you're describing uh it's their choice and after so like obviously like you see it's like a massive interview series on youtube now but you came off of this like off the back of smosh what made you want to start doing this series was it did you want to explore a bunch of ideas and then this was the one that like kind of stuck or was it always this that you wanted to do well i mean you know smosh was definitely a comedic like silly thing so i never thought that i was going to get into any deeper conversations like connecting with people in the way that the series is now um and the whole series kind of started off as a joke of course the the very first video when i left i was like okay part of the joke was that i'm an independent youtuber now i have no idea what's going on i'm a strong independent youtuber i was feeling feeling myself um and it was actually very true i didn't i had not uploaded my own video in years because the company had taken it over right so part of the joke was like hey what what does a youtuber independent youtuber do now when i was asking for advice and i uh interviewed a bunch of popular youtubers and there was something about that dynamic of having a conversation where i didn't know where it was going and the funniest moments were the ones that were improvised rather than 100 scripted yeah and i really enjoyed that and then later on it was like let's revisit and i was like struggling for a long time just floundering like what do i do with this channel and every every single week it was like i don't know what to do okay i figured it out okay i shot it okay i hate it so now i'm gonna figure something else out okay now i'm releasing this thing that i don't really like but i ran out of time yeah and uh eventually i was like what were the things that i liked doing most on the channel so far let's uh you know i'll dial in deeper with those ideas and then i started expanding on it from there yeah yeah man japan needs to start like listening to how you do your interviews because you would hate how interviews are done in japan i don't think i've ever heard a japanese interview tell me about oh god do you guys get interviewed like on japanese anyone you have to give them the exact script oh yes there's no room for yeah and they will sometimes have scripted answers about what they will say to you back so everything is preplanned there is you are not allowed to go out of like off script and it's just the most rigid interview you could like ever imagine is it is it like that in different places of asia as well because i have made i've also interviewed someone from south korea um and it was a similar thing right well they were speaking english to me and it was obviously not their first language so it's like of course they want to know what they're saying yeah yeah uh they wanted the questions beforehand and i i figured yeah they want to know what i'm saying to them just in case a word slips by that they don't know yeah but i didn't realize what they were doing was scripting their responses to such a degree that afterwards they sent me their script yeah and oh wow and whenever i i thought it was a little bit weird in the moment whenever i'd asked a question they would repeat the answer that they had already said and i was like okay well they were a lot more loose in the preinterview just talking about all these things and then here i was like maybe they're just nervous or something okay i get it people get nervous yeah but then they sent me the script and it was verbatim every single word that was said yeah i think they had a teleprompter yeah i think like because i i've done quite a bit of interviews with like industry people in japan and like a lot of them are like okay send me your list of questions beforehand we will approve all the questions we will write up like a very basic thing and i'm like okay that's fine but i've done enough now where i'm just like okay we'll follow your script but i'm gonna add extra questions yeah yeah and you won't be prepared for them and so i can really catch you out on what you actually feel and for the most part they're okay with it when it actually happens but i think if you tell them beforehand hey by the way i'm going to throw in some extra questions they'll just freak out yeah because they'll be like we're not prepared their teams will say like yeah their teams will be like no you can't do that but when i do it on the day of the recording and i get a good answer and a good conversation going then they're like oh maybe it's okay yeah maybe it's actually maybe it actually makes for an interesting interview they're not out to  me over yeah exactly maybe they actually are just like genuinely interested in me want a good interview i wonder how many people have to be screwed over like in order for that to become thus like how many bad interviews what have you done to get to that point yeah yeah but it does take a while to kind of build up that rapport that rapport and that level of uh respect or trust yeah with people you know and i've seen that too i i'm i have people that are a lot more comfortable with doing my interviews now than i think that they probably would have been a couple years ago before i'd really um you know i don't know if i want to call it proven myself but like i guess proven that i'm not going to purposely and maliciously try to like defame someone and ruin their career you never really showcase even like you know what most people consider strange things you never really show it it's like whoa look at this weird thing you're just like these are real people let's just see why real people do what they do yeah yeah if it is a strange thing i i like to talk with them about how yeah yeah and the thing is most people are absolutely willing to talk about how something that they do is strange it's not like they are so like in a different world that they think everyone should do this and if they think it's weird then  you you know what i mean yeah yeah but you've probably you've had people like that though right in the past in which way in the in the sense of like them trying to prove a point and being like no you're weird for thinking that this is weird kind of a little bit but it's still it still seems a little playful they're like normies don't get this so so they they still i think recognize that but yeah definitely people are a little bit defensive but i think it's because they've been shown enough times that they like they they almost they feel like they have to be defensive because that means that someone doesn't respect them and i think it's just a lot of like vying for respect of people yeah yeah do you often find like do you ever find people that it's it's it's a different field where you're just talking to someone casually but when you're in like in an interview setting with cameras you really have to like make them feel comfortable like being themselves and talking like do you did you find that a challenge with your interviews at all just getting people to be comfortable on camera as quick as possible a little i mean yeah and you bring up a good point i i do obviously have a limited time and i can't just spend the first like hour of the interview warming up yeah yeah yeah i i i go out of my way to really connect with people um you know we have the preinterview call so there's a little bit of that dynamic where we're already laughing together and we already are on the same page so there's that when they show up but of course they're a little bit more tense but i you know i'll meet the guests on the street i'll walk them in i'll bring them out to the back we do our covid tests and we like hang out uh you know like on this park bench that i have on my balcony and we just chit chat and uh i i get to know them and i you know tell them a lot about myself so right i think that there's there's like a method to kind of warming people up to so that they can see like that you're genuine and that you're not secretly going to be trying to get a one up on them you should have done that you're taking them out back now we used to do something similar we called it like i don't know i don't know if it was a strap but the denny strat so we there was a denny's outside of our office yeah often out like invite them to like lunch beforehand yeah like get to know them have a casual conversation but one issue we always found ourselves having was we'd get into a conversation and it would just be like  this is this is good material this is gonna be it literally happened like the five minutes since we sat down and we're like  yeah let's just like not ask any questions this is like good material that we can get yeah yeah yeah and that's part of the challenge also i mean that's the closer you get to someone the more you start connecting with them the more you start talking about things that are then difficult to bring back up and have it feel like the first time you talked about it yeah but that's what helps having my my questions already yeah because we actually go away from those conversations for a little while and then if we have a good conversation uh you know i'll write it down in my notes and i'll be like this is a good we need to bring this back up again yeah right yeah smart we should take notes this isn't a podcast we're just literally just asking for advice how do you do it you guys didn't have to get i could have just sent you a message it's like where were the questions bro yeah no this is great so we're talking about before like how many people you have to like run the show now so like how many people are there behind the scenes and how many did you start off with yes so uh i started off with just two camera operators and it was just myself trying to figure out what the  i was doing um and then i i slowly but surely had new people come on to help me and now i have 10 employees on the show jesus and uh you know it's it doesn't sound like that big of a number until you think about how much everyone needs to be paid there's a lot of moving parts so um you know from when i started i took two years of community community college and i started to take business administration classes right i i smosh started happening 2005 and i was like  college but um i realized i've actually always been interested in kind of managing a team and a business and yeah i think i think it's a lot of fun you know teaching and especially once you could teach like i have a head of post the main editor and i get to teach him all the things and we get on the same page and then there's four people that work um i guess below him as how people would say it but that work with him and so i get to communicate with one person he communicates with four so uh i just really enjoy the dynamic of a whole team working together and have it having it feel like uh yeah because because i was going to ask like how many people did you have at most when you were at smosh like oh my god how many points did you have then uh it's it's kind of hard to say because defy owned smosh right and they i think had 30 people working with smosh and all the side channels and live events and the live yeah all the there's so many elements there that i guess 30 was the the magic number i i i don't even think i met some other people it was it was a weird team situation where we all never really got to know each other fully obviously you know we're youtubers you see that lovely one out of ten system which is the most depressing system on earth yeah it's very black system in the world our viewers have heard us complain about it like a million times but yeah i imagine when you have 10 employees that yeah suddenly if you're getting a ten out of ten and then maybe you get a nine out of ten it starts to get a lot scarier right when you yeah yeah yeah there's a lot more weight yeah yeah i mean how do you deal with that it's like a did you deal with it like as a team or are you like gosh leave me alone i'm gonna cry i there's still a part of me that is affected by it i can't say that there's not yeah um it's and it's not not even like an outward thing of like oh  dude what am i gonna do but even if i just carry on with my day there's like a part of me where like my energy feels a little bit like something was pulled out from me a little bit right even if i'm not thinking about it it must be some suppression and then when there is like a 1 out of 10 i'm a little my posture is a little better i i've been really working on reminding myself that like uh a bad video now was actually a good video for me like in terms of performance yeah when i first started um you know what i would now consider like probably a lower performing video was it was a good performance and we still have sponsors and i still i try to look at what my actual progress has been for the show it's not just views that is it's so easy to think views are a measure of progress because they are it's the biggest number when you go on youtube it's attached to every single thumbnail in fact many people decide if they're going to click on something based on how high that number is yeah you see one video and it has um you know 10 000 views someone is much less likely than to click that same video with 10 million views because there's a curiosity aspect of wait wow so many people are watching this has got to be something right if there is a youtube video under 30 seconds that has over a million views you know you know what you're gonna get you know what it's like always a  youtuber and that shit's gonna be delivered to you with so quickly 30 seconds yeah that's it 30 seconds to have a banger uh but you know that is not my only measure of where i'm going with this yeah part of it is also like the the i want to grow respect and have people trust that i will treat them with respect on the show so i'm having uh people have with huge names people have started to reach out to me and say like oh i'd love to be on the show sometime and that's something that i never had before so regardless of where my my numbers go i have people that i really respect reaching out to me and wanting to talk with me and like have that experience of being on the show and that is something that is so cool and i could clearly see kind of that's my message yeah yeah yeah i mean was that so the whole youtube system and giving a  about analytics was that something that i suppose that smart underdefined media that you never concerned yourself with i didn't really because we were just on a salary right right so i was like these numbers don't affect me yeah i came in there like anthony man it's not doing too hot yeah i'm like i'm like oh man it looks like i have two more years yeah so it must have been like you were under smosh then under defined media and then now you're separate so there's probably that big gap where you didn't really take notice of what was really happening wow that's interesting so now i had to start learning all these yeah yeah yeah yeah when did you kind of tune out of like giving a  about what was happening on youtube or like kind of not paying as much attention and just doing it you mean like when i was defiant yeah yeah yeah um i'd say it was probably around 20 14 or 2015 probably to 2017 when i eventually left and decided to do my own thing yeah right um i think it was the two years that i was unhappy with where things were going and the way that the company was being ran and the decisions that were being made and how i was being left in the dark about a lot of decisions that were really important that were being made right and it was around then that i started to just kind of tune out from youtube in general you know i would still put a lot of my heart into making the things that i was making at that time but yeah there was still this part of me that was just getting detached from it and that's when i kind of stopped caring about browsing youtube and being part of the community as much yeah just when you thought you were out you got drag yeah they almost made it out of the rat race so do you think like not caring about it gave you more or less freedom than you do now because now you have to really you do have to care about the algorithm every youtuber has to care about the algorithm unfortunately i think it's kind of about caring about the right things and by the right things you know it's not to say there's a wrong thing to care about but like the figuring out what is meaningful for you and then caring about those things right right it's so easy to start caring about the things that seem like they matter most like you know just straight up view count yeah um you know but then you could drill in you could read the comments and see how much of an impact a certain thing made yeah um and you know you could realize that that is more important so you have to define the things that matter most to you before you just start caring about everything yeah yeah yeah yeah damn so like you mentioned something earlier just off the cuff but you were just like yeah so i quit college in 2005 because marshall's a thing yeah what yeah so so you quit in college in 2005 to do youtube yeah wow well okay i said it a little wrong so i went i went to two full semesters so i think it was technically 2006 right and i was signing up for classes and i was thinking about the amount of time because the classes obviously get harder the further along you get with your um with your degree yeah um because they start dialing into the actual difficult things and i was like okay i could be doing all these extremely difficult things for this yeah or um you know which is now taking my time away from this other thing that is now starting to build that this is a once in a lifetime opportunity yeah to um i felt like i was almost like the master of my own fate with this world well i felt like uh getting a college degree while obviously super helpful for most people i i felt like this is something i can always come back to right yeah and also this kind of puts me in a position where i'm kind of like following a system that other people have put in place for me i felt like i was making up my own rules so did you like foresee the  ecosystem youtube would become or you're just like no no i'm like i see it all you were confident no don't just have this like because obviously how many videos or like how where were you at at that point when you decided to go to college yeah what kind of stage was it at i think we had how many i think we had six videos out yeah oh my god yeah did you ever recommend to a youtuber with six videos no never do what i do never do what i do unless your parents are very well off and they're totally fine with you not doing good they want to help you how many subs did you have when you quit the subs were not a thing they were called followers and they were not a thing but the the reason that i felt confident is because this outside company that was competing with youtube called it does not exist anymore yeah they reached out to us and they were like uh they gave us this contract that was in hindsight very shitty but we were college kids who were still living under our parents roof and we were like you know what this makes sense we could fund these things that we love doing like we just had the best time hanging out and just laughing our ass off creating things and like yeah college because that's what the college kids really want to do most of the time so we signed a twoyear contract with this outside company yeah uh they they offered us 3 600 bucks to split between us but for two years so for for two years each no no each month okay okay oh okay i know i know i know it sounded worse it's still not great though uh so we each got 1800 bucks and we each also invested our own money from that yeah into the videos themselves and they also give us a little bonus at the beginning so i got to like i this piece a  car so i and like i couldn't do anything because every time i got my car it was like not where anyway so i bought a new car and i was like you know what this like we have a twoyear contract here we're pretty safe i could come back to do these classes if i if i really that makes way more sense yeah yeah yeah it was like one of the one of the first deals where a company was like trying to compete with youtube and uh part of their contract was uh you this video has to be exclusive to us for two weeks and after the twoweek period uh you can release it to youtube but it has to have a brought to you tag on the front and at the end and a watermark on it so so we like generously they even let you do that it was but their their whole uh strategy for marketing was that they were trying to steal the audience from youtube right yeah yeah yeah so the only way for them to get an audience on their platform was to let people know but unfortunately they didn't have anything to offer yeah that was out that was bigger than the scope of what youtube had to offer yeah yeah i don't need to get into the legality behind it but eventually we were able to get out of that contract because they promised us a certain wow i don't know if i should have said that company name you want to bleep it out on bleep it out okay yes thank you bleep out the company name so now i feel more i feel comfortable saying everything um so they promised a certain amount of marketing value and they translated that to a certain amount of views it was like some odd millions of views they were promising to bring to our videos on our channel on their platform okay they did not live up to that and uh when we started getting on them about that we found out i'm wondering how much i should say this is how many years ago now jesus is 16 years ago jesus uh maybe it's okay i think that there everyone there is probably um in a different i don't know buried underground yeah um uh so they they what i realized they started doing to to fulfill their end of the bargain right was um well first i noticed that we oh we had a million new views on our video on this channel this day okay so this this website where our view videos usually get 5000 views are now getting a million five thousand views right there's something up here so oh so so i go i go into the comments and uh i get um who  smosh what is this  i'm trying to look at my mp3s and this is uh why is this play i i find out that they also own this other website and they have a little hidden iframe uh that's like auto playing our videos in the background of this other website oh  so they'd go go to this website and then they'd hear the audio of our videos while they're trying to  browse this other website and it would count as a view oh my god so eventually we were able to get all the contracts we were like this is not very cool it's actually giving us a bad reputation because people think that we are doing it yeah yeah and then eventually we were able to get out of that and it was at that time that uh both oh my god my space was trying to launch launch a video platform i'm not sure if kids today know one of my favorites no no it's it's it's your space uh so they were trying to launch a video platform and they came to us with a with an offer and then youtube uh was like hey we're gonna there's this program where you can make uh money on your videos on our platform that never had any ads before would you like to be one of the first 10 channels to ever make any money on here we'll give you a guarantee and even though their guarantee was lower than myspace thank everything in the world we said uh yeah we'll stick with youtube yeah and that's kind of where everything started that was early 2007 that's what was that just like were you just just guessing or did you genuinely feel like i think youtube's gonna be the king there was this feeling also we had a video on our pokemon theme song lip sync like youtube videos uh so that video i think had something like 25 million views jesus christ and it was easy to see that the the market the the viewership was on youtube and they had just been purchased by google for you know way too cheap and which is still billions of dollars and i felt really good about google i felt good about where they're going even though i met tom from myspace you know myself i was like um google you've been the creator of myspace yeah yeah briefly uh he was just a dude i mean i don't know a dude wearing a nice jacket he did not i feel like everything within him was like i i can't do that i can't even give a thumbs up or smile no no he was he was a good guy did he add you in my space um was it we were already friends bro yeah but was he in your top eight friends that's the real question he became part of my top eight after i thought he might have a deal with him i'm like  if he's going to my page he's gonna know um i think he's photography now and he's a good photographer but anyway yeah um so i i went with youtube we went with youtube ian and i made the decision to go with youtube there and obviously it was the right choice yeah it just felt right you know yeah yeah right so you were getting paid even before there was even like an economy on youtube yeah yeah you know the funny part is that the all they were was the lower third ad the little tiny thing that pops up at like 15 yeah and even then you know we were afraid of the backlash that we might get for that's so funny so yeah yeah yeah we enabled it on our older videos and then the newest video we'd waited till like our audience bigger audience came in and left so that we wouldn't get flack for it and even on our older videos people were like whoa you  so loud it's an ad where you go your mouse everyone no one's on mobile you're on your computer all you have to do is move your mouse and click the x and people like  this there's one extra step now people watch videos and there's a minute and a half unskippable like whenever youtube gets sponsored they're like yes king make that money yeah yeah but no did you get like backlash when you had your first sponsor because i i feel like i feel like everybody's wondering i think yeah oh you mean smoothie king is that what it's not your first one it's the first one it's called smoothie king it was this like i don't know if they're independent or if they're like a chain but they're a smoothie place in like austin texas or i forget somewhere in texas i don't know and uh yeah we just had to make a little video there and put it up we didn't put on our main channels our second channel yeah they paid us like a couple thousand or something and it was it was like you know what was the reception to that though um what the  is is this but early youtube she's so wild there were absolutely no rules and i remember when i first started i would actually uh go out of my way to break rules to show youtube that this rule could be broken i'm just a bad boy and um one thing that i realized is that there was this channel that um i can't remember what the name it was in fact it's probably better that i don't say that yeah yeah they they they had videos that would just pop off but they'd have like 12 comments and i was like this this math doesn't add up yeah and of course as an 18 year old kid i was like i must get down to the bottom of yeah it's my duty uh incident detective mode yeah yeah yeah so i did a test on our myspace and um it was it was kind of what i learned from that other company doing the hidden iframe thing so i realize on on myspace you can hide an iframe as well right which is ridiculous i think that anyone could have any page load in the background yeah so i hid it on our page and um i realized that that worked so i said youtube um fix this i don't know i don't know if it was even me saying it but also a big thing was that that channel was also having hundreds of thousands of new subscribers i think it was right when they announced subscribing right yeah and uh i was like how is this channel that gets so little comments having so many views and subscribers so i also hid an iframe on our channel that are on our myspace that autosubscribed people to our channel and after like a day i was like yeah this is gross i'm not gonna have this on here so we removed it we got like 100 200 new subscribers i felt gross about it yeah and i think and you know in order to repent for my sins i went to youtube and i was like this uh is a way that people are cheating the system yeah so then youtube like within the next couple days added uh on the subscribe page they had a little button that said are you sure you want to subscribe was that was that back when you could actually talk to youtube yeah especially if you had a big audience on youtube you had it was like concierge just kind of get  done oh yeah yeah yeah yeah we went and hung out in um i don't know i don't remember saying i don't know san bruno san jose some some sand sand san francisco yeah and um you know hung out with people there that worked there and then wow chad hurley steve chen the creators of youtube yeah dude um you don't have enough subscribers yeah look at the good old days right it was so rare though for people to have an audience because most people that uploaded videos to one of the video clips we're oneoff viral clips so it was very rare for people to have audiences and have recurring you know videos of a specific channel so i think that they really treated everyone back then as like their gems that were like keeping the channel or like making something bigger because i remember back in the day it was just like you would go on like the most viewed you go on like the most viewed of all time and like obviously the pokemon lip sync was there evolution of dance yeah because i always forget at one point you were the most subscribed channel yeah yeah two separate times two separate times yeah it's like a three month period and a eight month period or something i forget how was that like how how was it at that at one point you were at the top it was it was really cool was it pressure though i bit there was al there was definitely pressure and it it um it filtered the way that i looked at everything that i did yeah um for better or worse there was there was the good of like oops everything that i make has some kind of value i should put a lot of my time and energy in this because i know a lot of people are going to see it and it really pushed me to constantly be pushing myself outside my boundary or out of my comfort zone because i knew that it would you know not literally pay off but it would pay off in the sense that a lot of people would see it and potentially be able to enjoy it yeah and on the opposite side of that there was a lot of getting in my own head about um the pressure and how i have to live up to this and then you're also always seeing comments of people saying like how is this whatever and it's a lot of um filtering it out to be like it doesn't matter that some people don't like this it's not for them but it would get in my head of like oh i need to i need to be better and it was a lot of like this this pressure um you were mentioning earlier about how obviously when you started you got the a deal from a company yeah i imagine when it was starting to ramp up and get to like number one most subscribed you're probably getting offered all sorts of weird and predatory stuff and just probably just the most stressful company meetings ever dude we had we had someone show up to my house was i was living with my mom obviously like in just like our small little tiny house yeah yeah sacramento california and there was this predator i i don't want to call him predatory but there's this guy came up in a business suit he's like knocked on the door my mom was like there's someone outside oh no so ian and i walk out and we're like uh what is up and he's like oh um i got your address because i saw that you just registered for a business and it was marked under this address so i figured i would just show up and tell you a few things about like what you could be doing what the  how you could be monetizing this and i was like i was 18 so i didn't know and it was my first time with like any kind of fame or i didn't know that this was a  up thing to do yeah so i entertained it and come on would you like something i drew the line there there was no invitations inside yeah um but he would luckily he was a vampire and he could not enter without me uh no so he he was like okay so your pokemon theme song music like video this epic cinema a piece of piece of cinematic work uh and he was like it has three million views so think about it this way i could get you sponsored by cocacola oh my god and if if you get a thousand dollars per million that's three thousand dollars in your pocket like that and i was like first of all do you actually know do you have any contacts with cocacola and he just started listening and i realized immediately that he was full of  he was trying to make some kind of a connection and he was like but like then mcdonald's and i was like dude so he clearly didn't know what he was talking about luckily uh he only showed up one other time after that yeah i was like mom when that guy shows up again you just ignore that the bad man in the suit leaving um but luckily we were uh i mean we were not very smart but we were smart enough to know that that did not feel right right yeah right yeah yeah because we were talking to like sean jacksepticeye like a few weeks ago and how back in like the early days of youtube there was just no boundaries between fans and like the creators so fans would literally show up at his house oh yeah yeah did it happen to you a lot oh absolutely yeah yeah so uh ian and i ended up renting this place together um he and i and we had another roommate with us too and um we lived there for i think four years and that's when our videos were really really really starting to become popular like right 2009 to 2011 is right and there are so many ridiculous stories of like mobs of people like i'm trying to edit in my editing room and there's like i just hear like people running around the house and like laughing and like looking through our trash it was people did not know boundaries because we were really stupid so like all blame is on us but because this was also during the time where you were doing the mail unboxings on the screen yeah yeah so i bet like that also came into it as well right yeah i remember like you know back uh back way back when i used to watch this mail in boxing oh yeah those are my favorites i love them i think at that time it was something so unique because obviously you know you know big massive celebrities would be getting this kind of stuff but i think it was the first time that like a normal person could just watch somebody receive all sorts of weird  yeah yeah like this is so weird it really did show you the scope of like how strange yeah yeah the common person can be with the items that they choose to send yeah yeah yeah and the drawings that they choose to draw that must have been weird oh yeah yeah what was some like the weirdest stuff you ever do i have some very good goto's for that don't you worry okay yes we got we got ziploc bag of dead bees what i want to know how did they collect those they might not have been bees maybe they look like bees i did not examine enough to know for sure we have a slightly smaller we have a slightly smaller thinner bag of nail clippings oh yeah everyone didn't receive  as well at one point um we received stuff that smelled like  that we never ventured out with it yeah yeah yeah i i felt the texture yeah it's like this is definitely give it a little smell elephant  um we definitely had uh boxes and we received so many boxes that we would sometimes just throw in our garage and they would sit in the humidity and it would be months before we get to it and people thought it was so funny that they would send us uh sandwiches and these sandwiches would just rot and oh because of like the food fight stuff i don't know why but it became a thing and the bags the ziploc bags would you know inflate with the gases from these things and then the scent would just permeate throughout our entire house yeah you'd throw away the boxes once they were kind of um you could see like patches kind of sopping wet or oily or greasy um but that quickly was like it's probably about time to stop uh receiving the mail like it was fun it was a great time period how long did you guys do that for i think we did it for like three or four years oh my gosh and by the end it was years of stuff just built yeah towers and towers a man oh god yeah but i guess every now and then you probably get something really  cold you're like yes yeah yeah we received some really cool  oh man lots of lots of used video games and then i would just take them all to gamestop and be like use video games and then they'd be like 100 credit i was like two games i actually won that's so big like ponies and cats so many weird games that i would never be interested in playing i was like i can convert these into games i want to play yeah just giving junk yeah just trying to get rid of it yeah well we we were given um a lot a lot of stuff that we were given were um just like people are looking for things to send yeah yeah yeah i'm going to send you something yeah and they didn't want to spend money on just sending because they didn't even know if we would see it right there's no guarantee we didn't even know if we would see it in fact some of the things i hope you know it's probably better off we didn't see half the things that we did but people would send us just old stuff that they wanted to throw away yeah because i wanted a garage sale or something right it was like old shirts that had not been washed in years and at all oh yeah because it was to them it was probably just like yo that's my shirt yeah yeah yeah so then we had to start being really selective about the things that we showed we had to stop showing the  stuff yeah the dead stuff the body the human body the human body the the anything that came from a human body was no longer making it in the videos yeah yeah we realized that we were encouraging it and then we also accidentally encouraged people to send us money because we had one video where someone um a few people sent us like one dollar bills so he's like oh we got 10 bucks and like it was kind of a joke and then uh then we had to make oh we got a hundred bucks and it was like we need to stop showing money all together yeah and we realized that anything that we showed was a direct call for people to send us more of it right so eventually we had to stop showing the weird stuff or the really grandiose stuff because we didn't feel comfortable with either right yeah someone might feel bad if you show off like something really amazing and they're like oh and i guess charlotte from like mexico sent me this like  and a lot of people were saying really sentimental right right hand written things that we could never actually like if i wanted to read every one of those and i really wish i could because they were they were so heartfelt like it would have been a fulltime job to do that yeah nothing else yeah yeah which is a great problem to have yeah i'm interrupting this episode of trash taste to give you an important announcement this trash's episode is sponsored by boxu anyone who watches

one like pretty much one of the first creators to get paid for doing what you do on youtube when did you start to realize oh this is this is like serious now this is like gonna get big i mean it depends like there are so many different uh levels of big like at that point i already felt like it was a big thing right right when we because i was like we're one of the first people to get paid on this platform that i foresee is having longevity yeah yeah yeah um but in terms of like i don't know it was a little bit dicey though so that was 2007 and then four years later i didn't really know what the fate of youtube was going to be yeah and and we had an offer from a company which ultimately um you know their name ended up being defy right and they offered us then to buy our company for stock it's totally great idea well you've talked about this a lot in your video yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah um obviously didn't end up being worth anything so how did they pitch it to you in a way that you both were like yeah this is a  great idea let's do it like how did that like happen yeah you know and it is a complicated uh i imagine yes too because because you know uh that like the state of youtube in 2011 it felt really like we didn't know where it was going was that before or after the google plus thing they tried to shove in no that was 20 that was when i first started so that was like 2014 yeah yeah i think it lasted like a year and they caught up maybe and then they were like now we're getting rid of it youtube has been constantly at especially in earlier days it did seem like it was like what the  is it it was it felt very fragile yeah right yeah so so they presented it to us as um you know we're gonna take all the website smoshcom stuff off your plate because i was doing all of that yeah myself uh because you know i was actually i actually made money before we started getting paid on youtube by designing websites for people right right and that's how we i was able to fund a lot of things and you know side tangent the uh our videos actually started getting we made like two lip sync videos before the pokemon theme before before we found out about youtube and um i i hosted it on my own website yeah and yeah there was because there was no website like youtube to host it on yeah yeah yeah yeah and uh i created a little thing it was a again it was an iframe a copy you copy paste there and when you paste that to your page i had instructions and everything when you copy paste it's your myspace page it put the video there and then it also had instructions to copy and paste for someone else like that was how i designed this like uh like copy paste viral kind of thing all right and uh i didn't know how well that was doing with the two lip sync videos it's so weird to say that we did beforehand uh but i did get the the bill i did see the bill and it was a couple hundred bucks you know and i didn't know how to convert that into how many views is this getting but i knew it was getting a lot of views or else i wouldn't have to pay a couple hundred dollars for bandwidth on videos right um so you actually used to have to pay yeah bandwidth before youtube offered the service so we found out about youtube by me doing a search for one of the videos i found that someone else had uploaded it to youtube and i sent him a message i was like hey this video thank you so much for uploading it here uh we want to upload it ourselves do you mind removing it and they said yeah absolutely so we created our channel smosh was still five letters still available yeah and uh that was the beginning of that damn uh shoot i forgot where we were going we were going with wifi he asked me about that why did defy like how did that all come how did they pitch it to you okay okay yeah okay i got off inside the engine because i was talking about how i designed the website trash station's all about just don't worry we're can write in write it yeah oh yeah seamless um so they came to us and they were like we will take care of the website so you no longer have that stress to deal with because every week the website was crashing and i was figuring out how to you know keep it up and i they they had this huge plan of all the things that they were capable of and how they had the infrastructure to allow us to do all of our dreams so they asked us what do you want to do with this company if you could make this company anything what would it be and we had these huge lofty goals they said we got all of that on lock we have the infrastructure we have the investors we can make this happen right uh and they offered us a certain amount of money in stock yeah it sounded really good more money than i thought that you know i would ever see in my life before that yeah so i was like that sounds great obviously this company is eventually going to go public that's how they work right yeah i did not know my lawyer did not tell me that that's not always the case the people that we had surrounding us that were authority figures in some way to us on the situation did not break down the details and how that doesn't always happen and how it's that's actually a huge risk so they bought full ownership and they paid us um in uh yearly you know annual salaries right and they had this structure set up where it's like this year yeah it's pretty shitty salary but next year it's a it's an okay salary but by year four you're gonna love your salary so did that happen it it it did eventually out that way and i was i was uh pretty comfortable with it i was like we are making a good uh salary here like we what do we really have to complain about and i guess they're doing a lot of the stuff that you used to have to do and they're looking at things and managing it but then also imagine as a youtuber it's probably quite difficult to give that control it was because i did give that control away and everything was not how i would have done it i ended up working double time to teach them how to do the things but then they were rehiring and the way that bigger companies work is like you're never just building a oneonone relationship with someone who like you teach them once and they know and they keep going with that thing and it's just a thing that happens now it's like no you're reteaching and reteaching and reteaching until it's like okay let's abandon the website and then it was like me abandoning a lot of the things that i had a dream of growing because i was not able to keep that up and also do the videos yeah i had to figure out where to put my time yeah was there a specific point when you kind of realized damn this is not what i envisioned at all when i kind of went out like was was there a specific moment or was it just like a build up of like a lot of things it was primarily a build up over a long period of time it was about four years in when i realized that things just weren't looking right and i still had two years on the contract left right and uh i think one particular thing was like they hired um someone that i did not know that they were going to hire and then all of a sudden i found out that they were now a fulltime employee in this like really important position that meant something to me and i was like wait i didn't realize that was yeah what was gonna happen yeah yeah and also there were times and i don't know how much i could say but i'll see what i can do there they don't exist anymore true technically uh there was uh a fundraiser that they they put on it was for a game and they had just seen the success of other people who had done fundraisers for games indiegogo gofundme type things and they raised like 250 000 for like these games which were like mobile games but you could play it on the computer and it was like this really cool thing with all these inside jokes from the community right and they said oh that's cool guys you do that and then we were like we don't have a concept for a game they're like ah we'll figure it out later you just just just raise some money they just made the fundraiser and then they were afterwards they were like make the game and we said we need to have something to pitch to people yeah you need and then they're like cool we'll just tell them the idea then because and then they're like you come up with the idea so i came up with the idea ian of course also we both came up with the idea and uh they were like uh cool you got the idea let's let's do it i was like we need to have concept art we need to like show a build of the game we need to be able to show what we what we want to do with this thing they're like ah we don't have time okay we'll get concept art so all we were able to do was launch with this concept art wow and uh launching a campaign asking people incentivizing your fans to give you money well that did not it did not feel right to me but i felt backed up into a corner yeah and um you know i think that's probably one of the things that i regret from my time there yeah is allowing myself to feel backed up into a corner to accept money from people that were excited about this thing being built of course you know we did accept money for that and i did put all of my heart and soul into making it as good as it possibly could be still didn't live up to my expectations and i feel like it was done the right way it would have but the the moment that really stood out to me was there was some there was some shadiness about um you know obviously the way that they pushed to earn money for something because they saw dollar signs right no because yeah rather than it being like those types of things if you're gonna have your audience fund them it should really be a passion problem yeah yeah yeah yeah absolutely exactly and i could have made it a passion project because i really was excited about it but it was so forced and you know rushed and then um there was um uh some some shady stuff about like the way that they contributed to certain donations to make to inflate certain the way that certain things looked and that's really all i'll say about that but it made me feel so weird about it i was like i need out as soon as possible yeah right i imagine when they were doing stuff like that the confidence you had in the the company was probably a bit like okay if they're willing to do this stuff yes not be going so and i realized that the way that they treated that was the same way that they were treating me and all the other people yeah so a lot of people lost a lot of money right i mean it was like crazy what was it i a lot of people lost a lot of oh yeah yeah eventually luckily i i i wouldn't say i foresaw anything but it didn't feel right and i got out a year before they ended up closing down right yeah um and another thing that that really was a turning point was uh i i had made a facebook page and it was i don't know i had like 500 600 000 um followers or whatever we call it just like subscribers uh and uh yeah it was just it was smosh anthony and they were like oh this has smosh the name so this is um we're gonna run this for you okay i was like okay yeah yeah sure and then i was like hey you know i was kind of trying to start to silently transition out i think they kind of picked up on the gist because we still were contractually obligated but i was like um can i can i get my my facebook back they're like no it's ours i was like oh but i i made that thing and you said that you just wanted to run it because you were going to help me post content on there yeah yeah yeah yeah like it has smosh in the name this is ours that's  up okay and then i i easily settled on that i was like oh okay okay it's fine it's just facebook who cares facebook and then they were like um they're like okay hey can we get access to your twitter and instagram i was like no no and then i i immediately i immediately changed the name from smosh anthony to anthony padilla after they asked me for access to that yeah in a way it's kind of cool that they uh kind of forced you into being like you know what  this i'm just gonna go on my own yeah  brand myself really it really got me thinking like could i do something on my own like outside of this brand that i had created yeah and it was really sad because i had made that brand uh yeah when i was 14 years old i i made that as like a little shitty website as like a forum for me and my group of friends at school to to go on and hang out with each other it was really before social media it was like we were either talking on aim or we were going on this website and uh yeah it was sad to kind of let that part of me this like this baby that i had brought into this world yeah kind of kind of go yeah god it must be nervewracking trying to do something yourself though right because like as a as a youtuber like starting like ditching your channel which has like millions and millions of subscribers to start to start from the ground up again yeah like i think like you were one of the first people i know like first big creators to really like branch off and try to do something themselves with a new channel right and then it succeeded and like there wasn't a precedent set before that really that you could really succeed by doing something new right i mean what fred did it oh yeah fred had another channel and then he did his thing well he did a few movies yeah yeah i did a movie yeah i was doing a movie i was doing a movie that was also another weird experiment a part of me because obviously i mean do you it's not a good idea i was just gonna  i shouldn't think i hadn't said it but  about my pride and joy listen i'll get it i want to talk to you right you actually did you actually watch that yeah i loved it i love i love it in a way as well yeah it's it's a terrible movie it's so  cool that it's good yeah but it's so fun amazing part of youtube history where like everyone had to have a movie yeah yeah youtube for some reason was like make em  movies yeah pump them out fred had  john cena yeah yeah yeah i completely forgot about them it was just a  cool weird time yeah where people were making movies whereas like i mean did you even want to make a movie was it like what was that like what was going on with that like because i feel like there must have been so many people trying to put their fingers yeah no it should be this it should be this no no no  that we should get john cena in it yeah yeah oh we got a song called steve austin oh yeah from the wwe well i was like john cena's not happy it's gonna be stone yeah i want to know about the movie like what what what was all that yeah uh so we i mean yeah a lot of people had movies going on a lot of people were breathing down our necks saying so when are you gonna make a movie yeah and we we did kind of have this dream of eventually making the movie version of a smosh sketch yeah yeah yeah and we we had a lot of uh we nothing concrete but like ooh what would the movie version of this look like do we get uh if we get a million dollars do we uh some we had some of the dumbest ideas of like where the movie was all uh smosh sketch uh budget and then we had millions of dollars worth of money pumped into the final scene that was our initial idea no because i remember on the smosh channel i this was way before the actual movie came out yeah you guys released an april fool's video yeah smosh the movie yeah we did it have you seen this video i think i've watched this this was like the last ever like april fool's like youtube video that i saw but it was like the first five minutes was like the most insane quality like oh my god this looks like a movie yeah and then the remaining hour and a half was you and ian walking back home with no cuts this is the greatest thing ever so then when i heard that you guys were actually making a movie yeah i was like yeah say psych for youtuber movies it was the what was the name of the one with the ghost uh ghost mates ghost mates that was one of the better better youtuber movies i will say that one was that was that one we had a little bit more freedom with and uh in a weird way though we we almost stripped out a lot of like what made smosh right with that movie so it felt weird because it like wasn't quite um you know a good movie and then it wasn't quite uh you know bad youtube movie which is also entertaining for its because you and ian are i think naturally very good on on camera like compared to like how some other people transitioned to the movies kind of thing i think you and ian did that a lot better i think it definitely helped that you guys were already acting in your sketches yeah yeah yeah there's a lot of that going on acting acting in your sketches i i heard a lot about how uh i should improve my acting uh in the comments but uh really oh yeah because they're gonna go into it they're gonna be like you're a youtuber you can't act yeah yeah yeah even if you did an amazing job like stay in your lane yeah yeah yeah yeah but with the movies you know with the first one it was a lot of um you know we did have the stream to do it but then other people you know it was at defy they they were like um we need to make this happen and we need to make it happen in four months four months okay i'm just throwing a random number it could have been six it could have been eight but i think it was somewhere probably around six months jesus and we were like um actually no i remember it was after we got to a point in the script writing process that they said this needs to happen in this very short amount of time we're like we're not ready we're still like fleshing this thing out yeah and uh it was a thing where we still wanted to make our videos on youtube we didn't want to give that up because we felt like we would have had to drop that in order to put all of our effort into making a movie yeah and they were like don't worry we could hire this person and they gave us a few options they hired a person the script was not anything like i would have wanted it it was a lot of like someone on fiverr yeah we found a guy it was a lot of like here's what someone who isn't in the youtube space thinks our videos and thinks youtube is was there someone who like worked in like you know hollywood hollywood movies it was like a hollywood uh script writer who who did like tv series and i think some movies as well right and he did do some funny stuff but um it was very much like an outoftouch perspective yeah and it was like i mean a lot of smosh stuff was cringy in its own right but like i was cringing at it yeah at how out of touch these things were i could not do these things there was this like area where like memes go to die that he that that was written where it was like a space uh was that in the no no no wait  there was it  i don't think this john's so familiar yeah you know i think that ian might have talked about it on a separate thing okay that's pretty long yeah this sounds so familiar or maybe we he and i both talked about at some point but there was this part written where it was like where memes go to die and it was he was like uh he was like tayzonde is in there and i was like okay first of all you're trying to make us say that these people are dead this sounds so that's kind of  up and then also you are saying here's all these things that are not in the now like we're it's just this weird period piece that just feels too soon to be a period piece you know whatever yeah it might age poorly yeah it also just sounds like a hello fellow children moment right yeah yes i know memes yeah i don't mean culture it felt a lot like that and then we we did a lot of rewrites and it was still a very bad movie yeah thank you how how it feels a little too hot how selfaware were you or like on set to be like guys are we are we making like i think i was half selfaware right right i wasn't fully selfaware part of me thought like after a certain scene happened i was like oh that might actually be good part of me did think it might actually be a good movie depending on the way it was cut depending on the way the special effects look yeah uh but the way that it came together was very much i was like after i was i was we were seeing like final cuts of it i was like okay that's the movie well i mean at least it's not as bad as shane dawson's movie that was yeah i mean it depends who you ask because no that one was really really bad was it i i did but i saw it like on the premiere night where there was so much hype in the room from all the friends and family that it was hard to tell yeah yeah is this a funny joke or am i just not in a good head space right now you should go rewatch it sometime maybe i will yeah that's interesting okay okay i never even tried that no no no okay okay well it was a lot of fun though and i i think that some elements from the you know from the smosh sketches retained their smoshiness yeah it's much easier for me to sit here and be like you made a  movie like i could do anything yeah yeah yeah like my movie would be good oh you gotta make it in six what i can't even spell it was a weird process because you know we had trailers and yeah we you know we had an acting coach and we had the pressure of like this is the movie uh it was something like a million dollar budget so i was like you got like the full hollywood it was the full hollywood experience and uh you know we had like a writer there on set to like do rewrites in the moment if we needed to rewrite something for time and like there were a lot of scenes that we had to cut for time and like they were rewritten on them it was such a different experience where it was not like i could still go to the director who was alex winter and he's amazing you know yeah um is he the bill i forget he's the bill or ted from bill and ted's excellent adventure the knock kiana you know oh he's the ted i think no bill i don't know the one that's not key yeah yeah yeah but but alex winter amazing and and you know his his kids were huge fans of smosh so he really did want to give it that genuine smosh view not sure what matt's calling it no matter how much heart and passion you put into something if there are a few elements that are slightly off it's gonna all fuel it's gonna kind of all get brought down to that level i feel like that's what happened there were a lot of great things that could have been but then it was like there were certain elements that just kind of brought it all down oh we got to cut the scene because of time that doesn't make you probably feel very confident you're like that's not good yeah yeah yeah but but you know a lot of times we're like we're going to cut this scene for time and we end up having this other scene that totally actually worked fine without it and it was like the rewrites were okay yeah um well they were your like sketches before scripted so you already already had were used like memorizing lines or were you like mostly improvised before yeah yeah they they were definitely scripted uh okay but usually we would like get a take that we like and then we'd be like go off book for the fight half the time we'd go with the off book version right um but it was a little bit different so smosh videos we would shoot uh you know 10 second clips of like this thing okay you say this thing okay you say this thing and uh you know when we do when you do a movie they they really want you to get like the full scene with this angle than the full scene the next angle no jump cuts no no  jump continuity yeah so a lot of the acting in it was actually me trying to remember my lines if i watch it i'm just like i'm just trying to remember my lines right now most of these lines like it didn't really get past that and also i got in my head a lot about like i don't think this is going to be the movie that i yeah yeah that i wish that could be yeah it would be so hard to like really turn up and give it your all when yeah it just doesn't feel like it's going wrong it was hard it was like after the first day even though there were so many people that had a lot of passion and good intentions and a lot of people that did put their heart and soul into it i after the first day i was like this doesn't feel like it's going to be what i thought it would be and then it was it was hard to get out of my head and get out of that right i guess you couldn't exactly go to define be like hey yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's like not like a youtube video we just shot the first day yeah it's like the sketch kind of isn't working let's let's scrap and go to a new youtuber let's do a new video you know yeah yeah well even even down to the sketches it was hard to say this video didn't work oh really because there was a lot of money that was invested into it yeah and we were given a certain budget each month right and uh if we scrapped it it would be like this is cutting into our overall budget let's just try to make this work so so when that pressure starts building up and you have all these other eyes and voices and budgets and restrictions that's when i think things start to kind of go south in those situations right and that's when i started to feel like things weren't really right even though like i could totally see why you can't reshoot a sketch after you shoot it obviously it makes sense yeah yeah but i think if i was fully independent there were a lot of things that i might have considered yeah reshooting but but when we have this uh level where we want the production value to be there and we kind of reach that point it felt weird to go back i now know that you could go back and it's fine but back then you're like holy  yeah yeah yeah would you ever want to make another movie with the correct amount of time and creative freedom oh man anthony padilla the movie i don't know i don't have any any drive for that i i have been pushing myself more with the intros of my videos on my channel that i do now it is scripted and i realize that none of the the passion that goes into me writing the words makes it on the camera when i'm recording this intro that's cool so now i'm trying to in a sense maybe i'm like reverse engineering a way for me to learn how to acting is by just actually giving the emotions that i when i write these things i'm like oh when you're when you say a line you're supposed to visualize it you're not you're not just saying it you don't just say the word yeah oh that's what acting is so in a weird backward sense i feel like i am pushing myself to learn how to act a little bit right and maybe you know it depends it depends but yeah right now no no no no no you've kind of done so much in the time that you've been on youtube like is there anything you haven't done that you want to do eventually down the line because i feel like when you just think about like even just smosh stuff it's like you guys have literally been at the top you've done everything you've done all the big top twice and you know like you've done the movies you've done you know did you release a book uh we released uh a graphic novel like okay yeah yeah i had a lot of fun most people don't even know that existed because they did not market it but i put my heart soul into a graphic novel but no no actual book right right that's something i never is that something you'd want to try or is that like something else we just like eventually i'd like to do it maybe i thought about putting together some kind of like coffee table book that goes through the different interviews i've done and talks about the different things that i learned from each interview the things that i've taken from that and been able to apply to my own life and the moments that stood out to me right um key things that i now go back to and think about yeah so an autobiography a little bit but yeah hopefully it could be also a way for people to learn through me learning like that's right that's part of why i do the interview series i mean to be fair if there's anyone who has enough material to write a cohesive autobiography yeah i don't i don't know if i feel like putting it in the term of autobiography i'm like uh who have written autobiographies yeah and you know they're just

because you know youtube has gone through a lot of distinct eras i'd say yeah yeah do you have a favorite youtube era where you feel like this is when it was the golden time of youtube yeah yeah i i think it was probably around like 2011 to 2013ish yeah yeah where there was money to be made so you and sponsors like people would take it seriously enough to fund everything yeah but yet there wasn't this idea that like mainstream media had yeah of like anyone can do this and become a millionaire yeah i mean i feel like it was still very independent and it just felt like creativity was what thrived most yeah yeah because i feel like that era of youtube all of the biggest creators at that time they all started youtube not to make money but just because they enjoyed the creativeness of it you enjoyed making videos and then i feel like after that kind of progressed into people realizing that you could make this a job absolutely and you could like people did it and it could be a business yeah which is it's a legitimate business which is nothing wrong with that but i feel like part of the magic was lost i feel you know because it kind of transitioned to into something else you know yeah a different mindset going into creating things uh and around that time or soon after is when i think the algorithm was introduced ah yes the illusive the algorithm the one god of youtube i'm learning more now that the algorithm really does reward the things that people enjoy consuming yeah yeah yeah and the algorithm's goal well no one individual knows everything in and out because it's made by so many people and it's taught to learn that's not scary don't worry the algorithm does reward the things that that do have the highest retention they have uh you know watching for the longest time replaying the moments most the highest clickthrough rate of what looks most exciting so i am learning that you can work with the new way that it's set up but it was definitely jarring when it first happened and no one knew or was told what was happening just like flipped to let's plays overnight yeah yeah yeah the fastest way to make repeating longform content yeah people would feel the need to watch entirely yeah oh yeah is it cause did you guys start the gaming channel around that time yeah yeah is that why because of the change or was it we didn't realize we didn't know what the reason was that these videos were popping up but we saw oh wait gaming videos that's becoming really popular people want to see this and a lot of people are asking us to play did you have a hard time when the algorithm did shift and you were still on like you know uh scripted you know scripts sorry scripted sketches and everything like that yeah yeah it was definitely a hard period i mean it didn't really affect us as much as yeah it seemed like yeah yeah yeah yeah we're still fine we still uh i looked recently we still have like a lot of videos from that time that have like tens of millions of views so like it was okay it was okay but um it definitely did impact the way that the videos were pushed out initially yeah so like after the first weekend i remember having a higher up breathing down my neck saying you guys usually get a million views in the first three days what's going on why are there you know it was a lot of like the stress of like what is going on and we're like i don't know no we don't have any  boss telling you that yeah and like their their entire company and all the x amount of employees like their livelihoods are built on the performance of these videos right so at that time we were really pushed to break off and create other side channels and experiment with longer form content things that required less editing i feel so lucky being like just like uh almost always independent like a one two man team with my own my personal channel because that's just the pressure's just gone it's a lot less pressure yeah okay so because like i gotta ask because i rarely meet someone who's been on youtube for longer than me for longer than most of your viewers lives yeah because honestly honestly yeah yeah i just interviewed who's like this really popular twitch streamer and she's 19 i was like so i made my on youtube when you were two and it freaked me out that's scary it freaked me the  out because i found out today actually that today out of complete coincidence is my 15th year anniversary on youtube yeah yeah so what is the secret to staying relevant for a long period of time on youtube you're asking them because you've been on for longer than me so so you're the only one i can ask for like like a actual perspective right okay okay well we could share perspectives here okay i think that you might have something to contribute okay yeah yeah yeah yeah i'll be mr seven seventeen coach my senior my senior now my youtube career uh can watch an rrated movie but i can't quite vote or smoke mine's in high school you know yeah yeah yours is gonna be legal next year you're getting your first zits and trying to be very very uncomfortable you're very uncomfortable about puberty yeah yeah you're starting to get the hang of it yeah um but let's see so the secret the secret is to never feel like you have it figured out right yeah the secret i think is to always feel like there is something new to learn yeah uh i i am constantly looking at the people that are growing audiences and i'm kind of filtering out okay this person they have a recipe and it pleases the algorithm i think maybe that's why they have used okay what can i learn from that okay this person has a really dedicated fan base they don't necessarily appeal to the algorithm but they appeal to an audience and what can i learn from them yeah so for me it's really about constantly learning yeah and uh when i do interviews with bigger names uh tomorrow i'm i'm interviewing tommy in it oh nice and uh you know he's got he's he's like is he 18 he's in school right yeah but uh like i i love picking his brain and and you know people that are new and coming up yeah on youtube right now and and learning what what they see in the platform now because it's something completely different and i feel like there was never a point where you as a creator on the internet where things are so rapidly changing there is never a point where you will be like got the figured it out yeah like and i used to think there would be a point that i would be like i gotta grind and grind and grind and eventually i have it figured out and then i'll just be able to sit back and let the thing just live on its own and i think that's kind of what got me into uh or convinced me that like selling to a company in 2011 was a right idea i had it in my head yeah the goal is to figure this out it'll go on autopilot i can relax and maybe do other things in my life yeah um but what i quickly realized is that i really love doing this and this is part of my life that i want to retain yeah and there will never be a point where i feel satisfied just relaxing but also if you sit back and relax um then uh you know and it's because yeah you're comfortable when you lose track of what's you know why things are moving in the direction they're going and what is relevant to the platform today yeah because that's really interesting to hear because like for your perspective you've really like been one of the top creators basically since the birth of youtube whereas i've been on youtube for a long time but i've it's been like on a very very niche like topic which is anime so i've always been able to learn from what the bigger creators are doing and try to apply what you know to try to apply what everyone else is doing and seeing if i can take that into my own my own niche my own channel and seeing seeing if it can grow out of there and how was that paid off like were you able to take those those lessons and things that you learned from the bigger youtubers and apply it to yourself and have it pay off yeah i mean i kind of felt like a cheat sheet you know i kind of feel like cheating because i'm just like you know i'm in such a niche topic that i could just take what i can just take what other people are doing yeah i just put it to put it with my own content but with you since you're one you're one of the people setting the standards you know one of people like you know i watched and i was like okay let's see what smart should do let's see what some of the other bigger creators are doing i'm like okay well i see what's successful to them but like i feel like being at the top of the pyramids and trying to balance yourself is a lot easier than climbing up from the bottom of the pyramid and trying to like stay relevant for sure yeah i think that some people uh see that see have a goal like get to the top of this pyramid just just stay afloat up here yeah and of course like it is much more comfortable because you have the freedom to kind of um apply more of these things that you learn on a bigger scale yeah but at the same time there's so much more pressure and i think that that's unforeseen to smaller creators you know i had my period i left smosh when i think we had 22 or 23 million subscribers huge amount of subscribers huge amount of pressure i go off and do my own thing um channel starts with a couple million and they're like people that don't really know what to expect i don't know what to give them and there was still that pressure there from me of how am i going to entertain these people who expect me to be giving the quality of content of a 22 million subscriber channel but now um it's just me it's literally just me on my yeah my own i'm really curious about obviously a lot of the viewers when you you said i'm leaving smosh i think a lot of people would see that and think oh it's just like uh he's just leaving a channel but i imagine there was a lot of probably behind the scenes or like friendships that were strained by that yeah was that like a like outside of just a business perspective do that put like a lot of strain on like your personal life like leaving that and put having to kind of be like all right i'm leaving this big thing like that because you know obviously ian is there and a bunch of your friends there well surprisingly me leaving didn't put a strain in and of itself like the idea of leaving and then me leaving yeah that didn't exactly put a strain i think maybe afterwards it did a little bit because there were really i think it was because audiences or viewers and commenters really were having all these different things that they were saying about like oh this person's better or this person is better or you were better when you were here or they're better now that they're here and i think that that added a little bit of it was unavoidable to see those especially yeah yeah i feel like you can't turn off your brain from wanting to to to keep up with the comments not even if you're not even trying to look for that yeah yeah i'm trying to see what people are thinking about this new thing that i'm just like uh trying to figure out and then i'm getting inundated with all these opinions from people and i think that that does seep in when you're not ready for it yeah i do wish that i was more ready for the types of comments how the  can you get ready for that the only way to be ready for it i think is to live in it yeah yeah yeah but i also realized that there is a bit of freedom in having a smaller audience yeah so it was it was a huge struggle and my videos when i first left i think got a million views each for like a couple months and i was like oh this is i i need to retain this and then very quickly once i think people realize i didn't know what i was doing i had no channel i was like uh each week we'll figure out something new and i hope you watch it uh and i i quickly lost this audience that i had and realized that they were not there just for me yeah and it was a little bit disappointing at first because i thought oh i i guess i have the freedom to do whatever and i thought that i had that with me and it was a wakeup call to realize oh but you have to make good content you can't just expect them and i uh you know the views i think got to about like thirty thousand to sixty thousand views a video on the anthony in the first year after wow and and at that time you know if videos weren't getting 100 000 views or even more people in the comments are just like irrelevant ireland abandon an audience for a different style yeah obviously that's gonna happen yeah like people don't see it like that they're like oh your name is like what do you mean you're not doing sketches anymore i thought you were gonna do your own sketches now right i thought that i had to i thought i was beholden and i think that the reason that it got to that point is i felt like i was trapped in this idea of yeah i need to create sketches i need to be funny i need to deliver something that appeases that audience that i've learned how to appease yeah yeah and um i think getting down to you know i call them lower numbers 30 to 60k i know a lot of people yeah are up and coming and that is a great perspective i don't want to discount that yeah but uh at the same time i i was like kind of floundering around at that number and first of all i had to get out of my head from looking at the numbers right it wasn't about that anymore i realized that i had an opportunity now to experiment without the pressure of an audience so that's when i started experimenting with all these different types of videos and all these different types of things and that's when i fell into uh doing i spent a day with yeah yeah yeah videos right and it was without that pressure and the first few were did have that pressure on me to be funny so i was kind of you know i did i spent a day with flat earthers and it was kind of like look how ridiculous people are weird but slowly uh slowly but surely over the next um couple months or half year i i started realizing that i actually was really curious about different types of people and uh i had uh i did this video i spent today with furries and i had a company help me reach out to these people and i thought they were all local yeah when they showed up i found out that one flew in themselves on their own dime and then this person uh like drove three hours to be there and i was like i was like okay this is and i wasn't i already wasn't planning to like to to say like these people are weird but a part of me was like i don't understand this this is this is kind of a weird thing yeah but you know they get there and they're they're saying uh i used to watch smosh all the time so anyway why are you in yeah so i very quickly uh changed my perspective with the way that i went into that it was like there's there was no way like and it felt it felt weird to me uh doing that the flat earther episode it felt weird to me like i was going outside of my element to to give the uh snarky commentary channel perspective that was really popular on youtube at the time i feel like i realized i was kind of falling into those tropes that were so popular yeah yeah and i was like i just feel like i need to just be me and have a conversation with someone be curious about them try to learn about their life and in doing so afterward i had uh you know them reach out to me they were really they were really excited about the way it turned out but also a lot of commenters were like whoa this is the first time i've ever seen furries represent in a way where they were treated with respect right and that is so weird i've never seen that before i'm going to send this to my friends who don't understand me and it was really then that i realized like oh this is what actually feels right this is yeah this doesn't feel like i'm not appeasing an audience i think i should be appeasing because it's the trendiness of youtube at the time or yeah or like this sense of humor that i felt like i needed to always like be this character that i was on smosh right i felt like i was able to actually just be myself and my editor then helped me throw in jokes but it wasn't up to me anymore i was just making a connection with yeah yeah back to like youtube boomer talk right yeah you talk you talked about you know constantly learning constantly seeing what's out there there must have been a point when you're just like i am so out of touch right now oh i always because i constantly feel that sometimes i'm like i get youtube i get i get the algorithm i get all the content but i get what people want to watch sometimes you just see something and you're like okay i am a boomer you see that one popular video and you're like why yeah why there's this one channel uh called ouija pg have you heard of that no no okay so uh i don't know how they do it they it's they got um they like they have a 3d cg rig of luigi and they animate him in his face to to react to things or at least this is what this is what the channel was a few years ago i don't know what they're doing now okay uh so he was reacting to things with luigi sound effects they're like wow and it was just like a reaction channel by luigi and i was like some of them had millions of views and i was like this is so bizarre but i loved it that was incredible i reached out i followed him on twitter i was like this  keep it up this shit's sick but it was so weird and that's i was like there is always something to learn about youtube yeah yeah yeah there's always some weird corner yeah and i mean now you're exploring that yeah now you're exploring yeah yeah yeah and those are the types of people that i really really enjoy talking to where it's like this community that's doing this thing that's that many people just think is bizarre like no yeah there's actually something to it and why does it catch on and we could talk about the emotional aspects of like uh the connection that people make and why do you think this is popular i think it's just really refreshing you know i mean obviously lately on the internet you know and even when you started it it was very competitive and everyone was always at each other's throat and i think it just came out of the time and kind of hit the right note of just like let's just talk let's just yeah yeah learn about each other yeah to be open yeah yeah and i i think it's yeah i mean the success i mean it shows that the audiences wanted that kind of content like yeah yeah people are curious about all the types of different things be it pony pony players there have been a couple of videos i've seen from yours where you do kind of bring back that like old school like a little bit cynical type of interviewer type thing like you know the one about like you interviewing time travelers for instance like that one was like a little like i saw like the little bit of the super cool side yeah which was just as entertaining you have to be yeah yeah yeah yeah that was right after the flat earthers episode quite detached yeah um but i feel like now if i were to approach that again the topic that i'm like a little bit like yeah i think i would just outright say this seems completely unbelievable right yeah do you have people telling you that and how do you feel about that right yeah i feel like there's so many more interesting conversations to have about that and i think a lot of people are uh either afraid to tell someone that their shit's whack or they all they want to do is tell them that their shit's wack and they don't want to hear why they do what they do right i think that there's like if you could just be transparent with anyone really like if you just have a conversation with anyone about why they do what they do you can make some kind of a connection regardless of who the person is except hitler not hitler yeah they grow up so far he's he's maturing how do you feel about how do you feel about tick tock because if there's one thing that does make me feel like a boomer and out of touch it is just tick tock itself yeah have you thought about adventuring into that oh we i have a tic tac yeah yeah it does really well with just clips from my my interview series cut down and yeah we did that as well yeah yeah yeah it doesn't work for you guys yeah yeah yeah yeah well i think that the thing about tick tock is that there is a an audience for everything oh yeah so you might log on and think this is  weird  but then there is a corner of the internet that is for you on tick tock and their algorithm is really good at feeding you content eventually if you get even if you sift through enough garbage for enough time and eventually yeah you will find the thing that that sits my favorite category of tiptop videos is somebody complaining about something really specific and then someone's like hi i'm the expert on that actually that's actually why it works and it's like who's who's the toenail expert why don't you come here it's literally irl reddit right let me explain yeah you it's just like the the strangest experts all come out and they're all good looking like that's the other thing everyone who is like an expert on something is just amazing looking yeah there is always an expert about everything and they look amazing and they're always like amazing why did you have to be so good and charming did they become good looking because they're an expert or which one came first they became an expert then they had the time to go and walk out and take care of them or is it that most people that look good or bound to be experts i used to be a model now i'm a toenail waiter it is really crazy yeah but it's such a cool platform but it makes me feel really old yeah and it's weird because i thought it was going to die i think everyone when it when it was bought when it was musically yeah yeah yeah i thought it was going to go down the vine route back yeah yeah yeah musically it was the thing and everyone was doing the musically like cringe compilations right i just thought that's just  for kids and then yeah wow everyone was wrong i think everyone thought it was going to die yeah yeah yeah when everyone just was just like that lip syncing or doing dances and it's like oh look at this funny thing the kids are doing they were nice man anthony was like i did that in my career that way they took my  i think it's the replies the replies and the ability to share the music so easily yeah yeah game changer i think yeah and it made editing kind of you know accessible to the i mean editing uh very accessible to beginners and like yeah people who don't know it it's like you just slide this thing across chop the video chuck it in put this music over it and oh you want a funny filter we've got that too yeah so it kind of made it more like less scary i mean you open up like da vinci resolve and you just have a panic attack you're like what the  is this like this makes no sense adobe premiere it makes zero sense if you don't watch five hours of youtube yeah yeah yeah so i feel like it kind of made it like very accessible in a way that kind of just worked and tick tock is always changing their  yeah yeah if you look at tik tok now versus a year ago it looks very different for that and the features that they add they are doing the upkeep yeah vine like they i mean i think it was clear why vine died for many reasons one being that you couldn't make money on it but also they were not like keeping it up they were not updating it and then unfortunately or not things on the internet platforms are need to constantly be updated to go where people are wanting it to go yeah because it is ultimately four people right yeah yeah instead vine opted to be like what if we made a sequel to vine let's make a vine too did they ever do that no no were those rumors or were those legit they were they were legit yeah vine was like we're coming back with vine to people and then tick tock was like nah yeah i was like no we go yeah well i find it really weird because like i feel like now tick tock is what youtube was like you know 10 15 years ago right where you know like remember when in back in the day where youtubers would try to get on tv which was like the old media in order to legitimize themselves and now it's like tick tock is trying to become youtubers themselves it's been so weird just seeing that transition i guess it's because the platform is so easily accessible yeah you were saying that anyone could jump on there and you can build an audience yeah on there people can find you the algorithm is very good so it's basically like if early youtube had an algorithm that fed people content that was directly relevant to them yeah and i think it's also like the barrier for entry for youtube now i feel like even though you know youtuber is like you know you can make anything on youtube and it will be successful you know still like the the quality of content on youtube now is so much higher than it was 15 years ago we're in like the the mr beast era where everything has to be a hundred thousand dollars i  stayed up for one week straight yeah it's like all right okay i can't compete with that because i just don't want to do that yeah have you seen any of ryan trehan's so he i feel like he's been reinventing uh yeah yeah what youtubers can now expect to do with the platform because he's taking some elements of the mr mrb style thumbnails that look very nice and clean and he has an elevated concept right for this whole thing it feels like a video game it feels like you're watching this person's journey in front of you and you feel like you can't click away because you never know what's going to happen but yet it is still a vlog and he can still um you know because it is a vlog where the whole idea is that it's low produced yeah he's able to make one a day it's quite nice yeah watching it and you're like this is like nice i just feel like it's not too crazy yeah like you know obviously love nostalgia i love watching a mr beast video but my god i feel like i'm a cog in a machine yeah like absolutely so and there's so much screaming and texting yeah it feels like a refined modernized vlog that has yeah yeah kind of like an elevated game plan the thumbnails are just the thumbnails kill it and i never would have thought that a vlog thumbnail which is not you know clickbait because it's not clickbait it couldn't look so good yeah right i don't know who do you like i remember when you know where back when uh you know youtuber vlogs were just you know you put on any digital camera you know handheld camera and then casey neistat came along and just used a dslr and made like basically like mini short films every day and people were like what you can do that that's possible and then everyone try to be casey neistat for a while and then he broke up and then he burnt out you know i mean he was every day yeah i mean when he used to talk about his schedule he was like yeah i'd wake up at 4 am and i'm editing it on the plane i'm like yeah what the  but i think what we can learn from that experience is that you know if you have something good you don't need to over do it yeah if you wanted to have any longevity you know part of the game plan is to figure out a way for it not to take up your entire life yeah you know i interviewed market player and he was like burnout is when people aren't refilling their bucket they're they're constantly scooping out of their bucket for their content and they're refilling it because they're not living a life outside of that yeah you need to have that balance yeah have you ever been burnt out uh yes absolutely i was shocked if you said no i've been like yeah it's always uh i was trying to be polite the question should be so when did you burn out like that many different times and every single time it was when i felt overworked um and then once it became like part of a company overworked underappreciated yeah um felt like i wasn't being um like my my opinions didn't uh quite contribute to the creative right um but then also outside of that i i was burnt out on my own outside of smosh after i left and decided to do my own thing right um for a lot of that time when the views were dropping uh i was also burnt out so it makes sense that people were not wanting to watch the content of someone who's burned the  out by their own content that's like that's not fun to watch there's a feeling you can feel when someone is burnt out by their yeah and then and then when you go to the the actual video and the top comment is like he's run out of ideas i'm like  you dude i got so many ideas and i just sit there like i have no idea they were right  call me but uh you know i i think i i really started to reframe what was important to me and then i started like not taking it as seriously not putting as much of my time into it and i was able to live a life outside of it and have thoughts that were separate from my work that's right it kind of helps reinvigorate yeah one thing i was going to ask is like because you know compared to you youtube boomers right here we are like we are very much children oh yeah nine years seven years right seven years yeah like i just discovered what boogers taste so it's like what i wanted to ask uh you specifically is like how much of longevity do you see as a youtuber being a career right because it's like we don't really have any like you know because like instead of like you know hollywood or like the acting industry or music industry right yeah we already have examples of people who have had careers for like 30 40 50 years yes right but because youtube is such a new thing whereas like i think the longest is probably someone like you right it's like do you see yourself doing this for the next 10 15 years again i mean it's already been half my life yeah so it feels like i can give my confidence to the idea that youtube will be around for a long time right they haven't made any glaring mistakes that are still glaring mistakes like it feels like they've made a ton of mistakes absolutely i'm not gonna write them off completely but it seems like over time they are remedying a lot of those it feels like they actually are caring about the community i'm not you know there's plenty of issues but it seems like enough people care to make changes to keep the platform relevant yeah right because like it's going come back i completely lost it because obviously people are going to be like what do you mean yeah and it's like i think as you were saying as a whole platform i think they they meant considering the amount of  that goes on the platform yeah yeah they do a pretty good job at keeping it relevant pushing it forward and making it the place yeah yeah obviously there's this place yeah because i think definitely like the the one moment that youtube like did a  and everyone was like this is the end of youtube was when demonetization became a thing right yeah and the ad apocalypse came out everyone unanimously was like this is it this is where this is where it dies yeah but it somehow managed to stick around for what five extra years that needed to happen though yeah yeah looking back at it it was an inevitability that it was gonna come to something like yeah a system like that was gonna have to be pleasant yeah they implemented a lot of things that help with that though like on the back end you can upload a video now and it'll say um i'm not sure if it's for everyone i think it's whatever you correct me in my problems right here bro we do not have any of those features and then after a half hour 45 minutes an hour whatever it eventually does like the initial check and then you can have some confidence yeah that probably caught it if it's going to catch something that you shouldn't have in the video yeah so that has given me a lot of confidence in the direction of that because monetization was a huge issue every time i would upload for a while i was like um i don't know let's see this thing i put tens of thousands of dollars into it might be worth nothing i might just be in the red for this right they did fix some things i feel and they're slowly but surely i think fixing a lot of the glaring issues yeah was there like a point where like this changed from you know because as with the way being a content creator is this changed from being a job to a career because like for the longest time i treated youtube as a job because you wake up and you're like maybe i'll be irrelevant tomorrow a week from now a year and like i didn't really feel like this was a career literally until this podcast when i'm just like oh okay this is like a business sustainable business that i can see myself you know five ten years in the future is that was there a point for that for you i think the moment that that changes with somebody in general is probably when you have a format that you know you can come back to and feel confident in and that's probably why this podcast was like we know the format yeah yeah you know it's kind of all figured out so that it feels like this is a repeating thing yeah um for me it was i think it probably felt like career when i mean when we were purchased by defy because right right right we had salary and salary i mean that that kind of i feel like is unique to me though yeah um but then after that you know going off independently the moment that it felt like a career for me now was when i had a series i spent a day with to go back to yeah yeah it was a repeating like a safety net like some something comfort you know i think that's the difference yeah when it when you know that you have something you're not starting from square one every single video yeah you know a lot of people are still trying to figure out what they're doing so every single video is back to the drawing board and that just feels like a job and trust me it's tough yeah because like i feel like when you're starting off at youtube you want to make like every video like a 10 out of 10 banger you want to be motivated you want to do something new every time then you realize that after a year or two of doing it you're like this is not sustainable that's all i need i need some kind of formula that i can fall back on because i can't always be you know at my peak of creativity every time yeah yeah so you guys are like 90 probably going into each episode 90 sure where things are gonna go you know and that that yeah yeah well going back to the beginning of the service well roughly we know roughly you know a little bit about what the dynamic is going to be like obviously i know if i say this thing or maybe he'll react all i know is that we're going to have someone on the show and we're going to be talking about their stuff well you have a name and you have sponsors yeah exactly exactly yeah yeah i guess like sorry no i was just saying like i feel like in in a weird way we're still trying to figure out that formula for trash taste in in a sense it's like we've kind of figured it out you know it's obviously like a lot of colored episodes deep down but it's like i'm i'm personally always like yeah you know scared of like that that moment where it starts to get repetitive or stuff you feel like a job and like luckily it's how i i don't feel that way right now about it but it's like i am scared to like fall into that so what are you doing to prevent it from feeling like it's a repetitive job oh i mean we're bringing it on tour now i mean we're yeah we're filming overseas we're getting you know all sorts of interesting guests and stuff like that and i think the specials definitely help yeah where that's like that's the moment where we can just like kind of really explode without creativity yeah but also those specials probably are what excite the audience as well right yeah yeah yeah i hope so right guys every now and then be like where's our fourhour conversation i wanted to go to work and listen to four hours and watch one hour of content yeah yeah yeah yeah i guess like my final question is what do you want to do in the future i mean you've been on the platform 17 years yeah is there something for your 20th anniversary got nothing planned man but 21st you don't know um i think i mean i just want to continue refining what i do that's what i've been enjoying doing most uh this i spent a day with series has been so fun for me because every single every single episode i see at least one element that i want to refine whether it's the lighting on the set or something that's like really technical like that or it's like my uh performance on the intros feels like i'm just reading words i'm gonna you know revamp that and try to learn it or like i i just went all out i did these tests where i reshot some of my intros where i have a jib like right which is like a  little crane yeah camera and i was like what if i because i was watching a bunch of really big youtubers yeah you know like erect for example and i was like he has these intros where he's like choreographed this scene um there's one that he either like about like what would you do if you had one day right so he starts off and it's like the doctor's saying you have one day left to live and he's like in these bandages and then he's like he just gets up and he gets out and the doctor is like where are you going and he's like ripping off his bandages stuff he's like talking to the camera he's like what would you do if you had one day left to live and he's like to the audience and he's bringing us through the cameras like following him and it's like this choreographed scene that just immediately right off the bat you know there was this effort that went into this this is a good setup for this video because i know that if the rest of this video is like anything like this first 30 seconds it's gonna be so much fun yeah yeah so i was like how could i apply some of these things that i'm seeing modern youtubers do right uh and apply it to an interview format i was like i can kind of choreograph the way that i say these things so i'm still learning with that and so it's hard to say like where i want to go next but i think more importantly i know where i want to go now and that's to constantly refine and not allow myself to get bored because i want to always creatively see where what is like right out of my comfort zone it's really cool that you've been on youtube for that long yeah i still want to get inspiration that's very humbling yeah like it's inspiring to hear that like you are still on your journey right yeah after 70 yeah after 17 years you're still on your journey and you're still figuring stuff out yeah because in my head i was like damn i've been doing this  for nine years i don't know what the  i'm doing i'm glad to know someone who's been doing it for almost double that also doesn't know wow you're not having fun man it's yeah if i'm if i enjoy what i'm doing like i feel like that is the best career that you could have yeah that's where you enjoy it not not the career that you know unfolds in this timeline that i prebuilt in my head for

use a temporary space if it's a temp space but what will it be guantanamo bay who knows remember out of any house that was really cool a lot of people preferred guantanamo bay we got a lot of positive reviews the usually the crappier the spot the more they like it it's true um they really like that shitty set they do yeah it does it does lend itself to a different type of yeah we are signing deals trying to get sets paid for and they're like no no hang up a curtain but you know what i do have to say it's like maybe it's the scrapper in me but there is something dope about rolling up to this set and knowing that like we all built this with our bare  paws yeah this was you know the og i remember i don't know if people cool  how much i told this story i feel like i told it but i don't remember if i did but for people that don't know there was um when we were looking for a space here i actually had somebody who had built sets before and this dude came with me to look at sets and then the whole time i was like well what do you want for this he's like i just want to you know i'd like i'd like to do i'd like to be a guest on some podcasts and i was like all right and then you know he we just talked about what that would look like and i was like yeah and then i go the only thing i want to make sure is like i'm going to sign a a deal i'm going to sign a lease on this place that you're not going to you're not going to bail on me right and he was like no no no he's like i just you know i want to be involved i was like okay we had long talks about it and then i signed the deal i was like it's signed man like i got it when you want to talk about like getting to work on building a set and he was like well what am i going to get for that like what kind of piece of the action will i get and i was like what do you mean he was like well you know i need like a percentage of things and i go i thought you said you know all this stuff and he goes well yeah but i mean i'm not just gonna i go oh i can pay you they offered him like cash like here's money to pay he goes no no i don't want that like i want a percentage of every ad sale i want um yeah i want to be a guest once a month i want um promotions for my things and i was like what are you talking about he was like yeah i can't be involved with you and i go wow so i just wrote him an email telling him you know you're out of your  mind well just thanks for being exactly what i thought you might be a piece of  yeah and then like it might have been a year later i got an email from him i just he goes i just want to say i'm sorry for uh for how that happened oh wow yeah did he take responsibility for bilking you and not being upfront sort entirely it's it's totally the show business model um i'll wait until you're done texting no no i'm looking up a name i'm looking at the name anyway it's such like a typical showbiz behavior to not be upfront with what you want right it's like sign the paperwork oh but we didn't mention that it's gonna be and you're like dude just like why are you not up front like my pool guy is up front with me like here's the rate yeah here's what it can be here's the return it's like why why is there always so much secrecy in this business yeah and why this guy had to be like this um okay i found the email that's what i was looking for uh just uh let me see if this is how it is hey uh okay here it is tom though i know the value of what i provide okay so far no repentance go ahead and i thought i made that clear from the beginning what would help me provide it i'm literally haunted weekly by the fact i said i won't let you down uh this is like like more than a year later more uh you know that's that's how i've been i tried to let people down if you still if you still need help i'm in this is after we've been like uh just thank me on your show just thank me on your show if you're all set that's great uh happy new year to you guys this is like from a few years ago uh and yes post here i'll have some free time i was like jesus christ this guy's  sounds like a cool guy yeah he does he doesn't sound very repentant especially if it starts off with you know i've got a lot of i bring a lot to the table yeah i was like not a very it's like when someone breaks up with you and then you're like you know i'm a pretty great catch but uh sorry i said some stuff yeah and you're like what kind of what is this letter what is this what is this yeah why do i need this people are so  crazy out here yeah it's a very that's a very i won't say la message again it's a very like hollywood it's showbiz yeah showbiz message of like remember how i  you yeah yeah i didn't really mean to i know uh also if you need me i'm around hey remember i  you over would you like more of that it's always like that it's so funny how you just deal with people yeah for years and you're just like wow that's the nature of this business they just  you in your  it's so crazy it's wild that it's work it's okay i have to tell you though too like living in austin we're really out of the show business wheel yeah and then coming back into it for just the summer it's different it is very it's a real different culture like you see it more distinctly now like my life is so small in austin yeah it's just like kids school i'll make the kindergarten moms every now and then for some queso and some tequila gig here and there yeah that's not this complicated um all right let's let's do the opening clip one two all right here we go  do what i never had no  hell yeah you gonna go you gonna get some yeah all right okay i see you there everybody bro cool who is randy don't bring anyone  welcome welcome to your mom's house  welcome to your mom's house  that's terrible no just tastes like chemicals  i never had no  um because oh this is a tick tock i was going to say they should be on tick tock yeah this sounds like one of my catches at first i i thought i really thought it was a soldier and then he when he walked for a second you can see he has different pants like it's just i think it's just a camo jacket i mean it didn't mean that he wasn't in the service it's so stolen  valor yeah yeah you're not supposed to wear it right if you're not but someone tells me he doesn't he doesn't know it could be a jacket he found could be a siblings sure he could he could have been uh dishonorably discharged you know yeah he was toast but it's cool to tell people that you don't know hi hey rolly renault down hey man i never had no  before i love do what yeah do what is such a great phrase do what yeah what's that do what yeah yeah do what is is i mean because we don't say do what in texas it's very southern though but do what is like you you did what like you're saying like yeah like what the  basically what the  yeah do what i love it do what i never had no  no no no  yeah he's got something going on he never had no  he was like well you gonna get something yeah i like that hell yeah all right well what a positive way to respond to that because somebody telling you i never had no  at a gas station it might be alarming but that guy rolled with it and encouraged him well it's a good it's a good lesson to handle crazy things being said to you yeah is um keeping that upbeat attitude yes and is the best way to not have it escalate into violence yeah yeah well that's what the groundlings teaches you in improv yeah yes and when you meet a homeless person you yes and them that's right yeah it is the first rule of improv in case you're wondering it is too yes and what it means is that you don't negate what your your other uh improviser has thrown at you so in other words if she goes these donuts are hot you don't go they're cold because you just  up the improv you just killed the scene you start to go like oh god they're hot like you have to build on what the other person says it's a great way to work with the mentally ill as well  how dare you yeah you think this guy's mentally ill yeah i think he's just i think he's talked is it mentally ill or rworded um i think he's yeah i think he's not well rewarded i think he's not well in the head yeah yeah especially if you're wandering gas stations telling people about your lack of  i'm looking for girls i'm looking for girls can i have another sip of that you just said what you just talked about i want to try it again because you know i don't i still don't have my taste buds i think i taste like 60 man please taste it it tasted like straight chemicals when i drink it before like does dc taste like chemicals to you is that what it's supposed to taste kind of i don't know yeah i'm looking for girls for  yeah this just tastes like chemical it's pretty gnarly i love it no calories 16 a day all right um yeah tastes like  there's uh some real cool stuff out there um something i wanted to show you baby i knew this would get you fired up that's right i asked for it sure you've referred to people with a capacity for pregnancy would that be women many women cis women have the capacity for pregnancy many cis women do not have the capacity for pregnancy there are also trans men who are capable of pregnancy as well as nonbinary people who are capable of pregnancy so this isn't really a women's rights issue it's a we can recognize that this impacts women while also recognizing that it impacts other groups those things are not mutually exclusive senator hawley oh so your view is is that the core of this this right then is about what so i want to recognize that your line of questioning um is transphobic um and it opens up trans people to violence i feel like that guy senator what's his name well this makes me okay so he's like so he's like wait we're here to talk about abortion and women and she's like no we're actually here to talk about the fact that you're transphobic yeah it's like she's totally it's just pointing out that he's a bad guy yeah you're you're a no good meanie it's so dumb i mean he might be a bag of  i don't really know i mean senator hawley i don't think he's probably a great guy he looks like a bag of  he looks like a typical republican douchebag yeah exactly wrong right but this is so indicative of why the left is bananas now they are so crazy so crazy you go you're talking about like abortion and reproductive rights and then someone's like you mean people with a capacity for pregnancy and then attacks you for being transphobic for talking about it i mean that's why you know she's a  lunatic like that's that's really what this is and people are scared to say it now yeah people get scared to point out how crazy it is to talk like this  psycho you know who's you know like just just you're just speaking nonsense you mean people with women's organs well that's how you should talk about it yeah as a trans man or a nonbinary person that can get pregnant has women's reproduction right because look i think i think for me this is just crazy the whole thing gets convoluted to me there should be two things and maybe this makes sense in my mind are there two biological genders there's male reproductive organs female reproductive male female sure that's biological  facts it's called science now within that you can express that gender differently you can be astral gendered yes absolutely but to say that there's more than two genders is scientifically  inaccurate so the the man that's pregnant guess what he has yeah a  uterus yeah that makes that's a biological female part we know thank you your honor i just  explained everything god damn it i get so  annoyed at these people it just makes you want to  you know tell them let me put my tongue in your hands yeah if someone relies on you financially a child a

these other groups when you say it's hateful it's like it's not hateful can we just he was just getting on with it like it's just common sense can we just talk about you know can we live in reality for a moment do we have to be in the  upside down every time we have a conversation every f i don't and i don't know what to do there's nothing illogical about or nothing harmful being like yeah there's there's two biological genres but people represent that within a spectrum people express that within a spectrum yeah exactly express it do not use gendered language it makes me crazy these people and these people ruin reason she had a great moment to talk to this guy about abortion rights and he said she's wasting it on this  horseshit you're putting people at heart shut up you're beating people at harm for violence and just to point out you're being transphobic oh shut up retired so well and to be clear like tom and i are not every time i feel like i talk about this people are like oh christina's rightwing conservative i'm not  i'm not dude i know i'm j i used to be liberal and then these nut bags took over yeah so i don't know what the  i am anymore but i know i'm not i'm not on this because here's the truth and the truth is these are the new crazies the crazies were rightwingers i know right ultra rightwingers you're like you are the religious lunatic yeah and then everything got flipped to now like the hardcore left they are the new  psychos yeah or you can't have a conversation with them but you can't have a conversation with a tea party person no now you can have a conversation with this   because she's gonna just spin it in like you'd be happy you'd be like yeah you know abortion she'd be like let me point out something you're being really transphobic right now and you're like okay okay we were just talking about abortion rights okay um now you just made it about something else you know i'm gonna go get something to drink nice to meet you but i also think i feel in my heart that life is shades of gray it's never black and white it's not like being on one team or the other it's always somewhere center it is but then it is somewhere right of the center you can still say that all that is true and that this is nonsense this person is spewing nonsense it's like they these people want a cause they want yeah they want a bandwagon on something and now it's pointing out who's a big bad meanie this reminds me of going to that gun range and posting it and people were like didn't know what kind of person you were um like unfollowing and i was like what and they go didn't know you were like a gun nut i go i'm at a gun range just shooting guys shooting guns with like at a safe like this is just an activity yeah they're like i didn't i mean you know there's gun violence in america i'm like what what are you talking about you know but that's like that's what this is now people you you go i'm at a gun range and they're like oh you don't care about children in schools huh what what are you talking about like exactly it's just it's so illogical it's like that analogy you've seen on like the memes where somebody's like i like apples and then they go yeah but you don't you don't mention oranges how do you feel about oranges you're like god guys i guess you can't do it yeah why can't somebody just be a blend of many different it really speaks to just the fact that there's extremism and you can be extreme on either side whether you're far right or far left either in either case you are fully  so that's the yes and also too i would like to say is that i can listen to what she's saying and go yeah okay i'm gonna consider that like it's not completely untrue she's saying blah blah yes and then somebody on the far right can say something every now and then you're like okay the okay i guess like you can consider different  opinions sure just consider it yeah but in this context  this is not the time to correct him on his transphobia it's just live on earth you know like live in in reality don't live in this makebelieve land yeah don't be the kind of person that you know you can't talk about like anything and without crying feminine this  who is excited to go back to another garth brooks concert is like he blew him you blew them out of the waters it's a special experience how do you explain what is that what is that special experience that people are getting i wish i knew because i don't feel like it's anything crazy i just feel like there's a connection that's nice because when i go try to remember before you ever step on stage you're a fan and so we still go to concerts i mean sure we just went to bruno uh we went to urban uh jt and in those moments when you're in that crowd all you want is that artist to look at you for three seconds and you can go hey man thanks for your music it's been cool and as an entertainer it's the same thing you're just looking in their faces just to say thank you for my life thank you for my kid's life i can't believe i'm getting to do this and so i think that connection that goes on and it doesn't matter where you're at and people go man can can can the artist see us way up yeah 100 percent you can see it feel it and so i'll call them out when i do to make sure that they know me and them are on the same line he's really he's you can see his eyes are welling up but he's making me cry because like i feel some similar way you know it's great being an artist it's special yeah but tom let's be honest can when you're doing these huge venues can you see the person sitting up in the nosebleeds can you see their face i mean you can't no but i know what he means like because well he plays music so you recognize him so like when i walk on stage i always try to like shout out to the balconies right and you like you recognize and then you do it at the end right or you might even during the show but you know i think his thing is like he wants to like make eye contact that's what i'm saying every person but what he's claiming is not that's not true he's playing stadiums so yeah his big ass stadium tour he can't do that you can't really really do make those connections that you see someone in the crowd and go we're doing 100 yeah and then what's crazy is you see him and go wait a minute i've seen you before then you know they've been at other shows so it's it's a it's a cool family within the band and crew and within the people that come to see the show yeah but what does that mean to you to hear those sort of like long long lasting fandoms oh that's sweet i don't think it has that much to do with the artist i think it's got something to do with the music i really do because there's something about the music that pulls you something that strikes in your in your lifetime that you relive all of a sudden you hear i know because i'm a fan of music so when you're sitting there all of a sudden somebody might come there for thunder rolls and that's all they're waiting for other people coming there for the dance but then what happens is while you're waiting for your song these other songs start to fill in your life and you see what's going on with people around you it gets really good man sorry i'm emotional it's just uh i just i love getting to do this you  lunatic yeah can i tell you i have a new i think i know what it is what is it okay whitney will not mind me talking about this because we did on her podcast for you when my name was in austin we were in the green room and she was like i was diagnosed as autistic i'm technically on the spectrum and i guess in the moment i had a little something to drink and i was like oh that makes so much sense like i said it out loud and i didn't mean to sounds like something you would do so anyway we've we've talked about it since now that i know somebody with it i'm thinking our friend garth is on the spectrum but hold on you anna hold on remember that time with trish and he went and then go to duh he's mimicking emotions constantly but he's also feeling emotions however elon musk will often cry in interviews i've seen elon cry and he's asked as well okay that's how the um australians say it us bears elon's cried so they're not incapable of emotion sometimes they can't it's inappropriately maybe okay could be i'm going to put the theory out there if you're if you're watching this and you're like a person that diagnoses can we can we google autism asperger's he may not be diagnosed who's g on this uh is he on the spectrum or is he g is an r oh my god he's not an r but he's definitely on the on the tram he's definitely on the truck yeah he's a musical genius okay chris gaines is definitely rworded the cutest lady today out of town out in the country and we're talking super fan stuff and we're like what's your favorite member she's like listening to the river high school in the car mcdonald's drivethrough ready for lunch and we gotta get there quick and all my girlfriends were singing so and she got emotional i'm like what a very specific like memory so it was very cool she's a great lady and she's coming tonight she's really excited what's the best like when i hear that song garth this is right and you're like that is that is crazy does the one stand out for you well i mean that one right there i mean to think about it that just tells me that the river really affects this woman which means tonight if i know she's in the crowd i'll do it i'm going to try and do it the best i've ever done just for her that's good he's about to  fall apart right now i know you know i got to tell you something i feel the same way performing on stage for you guys sure when you scream bikes or show me how those big tits fart when i come out i go man tonight i'm gonna yell bikes and i'm really gonna think about you and how it made you feel the first time too just give me a second all right uh we'll take a quick break and we'll be out in a moment all right we are back and you guys know him if you've ever been on the interwebs uh if you follow comedy he's got a special that's out right now you can go to the andrew schultzcom and see andrew schultz infamous uh andrew schultz thanks for coming man thanks for having me yes i'm very excited to be here we're excited to have you yeah you uh you you're like the like the the the comedian that people are championing because you have been wronged by corporations i'm a victim you are a victim you've done the you've done the best job that i've seen since i mean i remember in the pandemic um you know you the people did different things everyone had to adapt yeah yeah and you started doing these like like it was like what people who like um late night monologues if you go like oh i wish these were good yeah you know like i wish i wish the jokes that because everybody knows comedian like comedy writers who write for these shows and they go like well like all the stuff that i get that everything is good the writers are funny that's the thing about people they don't know some of the funniest people in the world are comedy writers on late night television shows yeah and some of the worst comedy in the world it comes out of that yeah well because they have to sell advertising so they want to clean it up and make sure that we don't offend grandma sitting in kansas city something yeah so the new  up comedy it totally does and you guys were putting out these things all the time that were like punching yeah but you kind of it did make you think of like i wish like the  tonight show would do this yeah right you know yeah it worked people watched them people watched them people were talking about them and um and like yeah i think it probably it very much elevated what you know your profile 100 yeah and then you also did the thing that i have been celebrating this for a long time which is when comedians you know like there was this like thing where i've heard people go like oh this dude's got someone a special on youtube yeah so clearly you know he's a  zilch or something and you go you know that youtube and netflix actually have the exact same concept which is we have content and we want you to get lost here yeah we want you to stay like we want you to stay on netflix here's a million things to watch youtube has a billion things to watch and so you go actually you see that like you put it out uh mark norman yeah jane gillis giannis like all these comedians go like here's my special and then you see the view counts you're like yeah i don't think this is a bad idea yeah yeah these things have like five seven 10 12 million views yeah that means that all these people who didn't maybe didn't know these guys and now you see like they're selling tickets like this this worked the same way yeah that netflix did yeah it's almost like it's the new netflix did you you know what i mean like it is the doing it on youtube is the way to yeah cause like for me like when i when i first first started doing the youtube thing like i just couldn't get on comedy central i couldn't get on netflix whatever reason like yeah nobody they just weren't giving me a shot and i had like good exposure on like mtv and these types of things but yes they just yeah i guess maybe it was like my brand of comedy or whatever i hate that  term but like i guess they were like a little bit concerned like okay here's this white guy he's gonna be making fun of a bunch of different like people that don't look like him right and you know you keep getting the same responsibility punching down or whatever that  term is which is like in and of itself kind of offensive yeah yeah cause i never thought of these people as down like i grew up with people of different you know cultures and uh and then i i remember i was like all right well  i'll just put some stuff out on youtube and i put out i put out a special on youtube it wasn't even special it's 15 minutes yeah but it was like four different clubs in new york city and i and i did it all in one night and like the cab rides in between sure it was just like a fun little thing and i remember like the week after i was at like the san diego comedy company or something like that right you know that club yes yeah yeah and i and i sold it out nice i never sold it a club out you're like holy  and i was like that's weird i was like maybe this is like one of those clubs that like people just come out no matter what yeah you know there's like acme yeah it's like that the the one in um wisconsin what's the comedy on stage yeah they just have like a great audience so i'm like okay that's weird then i did another club i did like the funny bone or something like that like columbus and then like that one was sold out and i was like what the  is going on so i started like asking people after the show i'd be like hey how did you find out about the dinner like oh i watched your thing on youtube and i was like okay that's interesting yeah and then i did like a week of of standup on youtube for a year so every week i put a new clip out for a year wow and i was fortunate because i've been touring for so long without having any stand up out yeah so i had a bunch of bunch of material right and i was like  i think youtube and instagram this is the way and like i remember one time a clip went viral and it was i had this it was like on super bowl sunday i had a joke and it was like uh i was like uh yeah countries that treat women the worst have the best food yeah that's a funny   okay right so it's like and it's weird like people that have saw the bit it just like read it made it  go yeah and like everything else trickled down after that i'm sure you guys experience this too like one thing goes viral like when you guys  made andrew tate a superstar remember that when now that my whole  algorithm is andrew tate like i can't even open tick tock with my wife because every other video is like  need to be quiet put their number on the forehead dude you're a guy's fault you know 100 when i did you had to spit out the  coffee if you didn't spit out the coffee when i did uh my birthday shows in chicago they were at an arena and on my birthday they they played a super cut of people wishing me birthday happy birthday please and it was like it was like mullany chappelle burke like all these people and then andrew tay and they went well they went crazy and also that week he was arrested for trafficking women yeah no like dude and so you hear people go like oh my god whoops yeah charges were dropped i want to say tate i know those charges were dropped and you didn't do anything so i didn't know the charges were dropped yeah and i still wanted them on the podcast yeah because it was like it was just charges yeah you know and uh yeah i don't know maybe he was talking a lot of  or whatever he's  fantastic on mike i mean he's so funny and he's like i'll be honest that he is a smart guy he's actually a very smart guy super articulate has like he's charming he's charming and he actually gets that it's a joke he gets the thing he gets that he's entertaining yeah and sometimes you listen to him and you're like is he  right yeah i think this guy's  right you're like do i agree with this dumb woman i should know my place yeah but he's not wrong about stuff sometimes there's like moments where like guys will say the most atlantis  but then like add a joke and then it just makes it kind of charming like there's that sean connery interview you know at the end of it he says a joke and then what'sherface laughs yeah yeah oh i forget the joke barbara walters yeah yeah yes barbara and barbara walters kind of chuckles and it's like oh you are james bond yeah yeah yeah yeah nobody can stop you like you can talk about why you should hit a woman and then make the woman laugh immediately what's interesting with this whole being offended culture is barbara walters came up at a time when it was really hard for a woman to be an interviewer and she truly got  on by the patriarchy and here's sean connery being like i'd like to hit women yeah yeah yeah and she sometimes it's the only option yeah it's your fault like that he did say he's like you've tried everything you tried everything you tried everything else and they just keep going yeah they keep pushing you got to kind of put her in her place but even she was light enough to laugh at them he had like a witty reaction yeah i forget uh i forget the final  line but yeah anyway so funny i don't know where we say yes so just like putting this stuff out and i found out that that youtube and like instagram the algorithm really helps you it's like what happened with yo netflix early on like you guys were part of this but i also see you guys as like you were successful in your own right outside of netflix it's not like you guys were made by netflix do you know what i mean like you guys have built up your ecosystem so i'm sure like netflix definitely helped people tell you for sure but you were established in terms of like your fan base and the people that knew and that was probably increased by the exposure right yeah yeah but then we also saw people that went from like barely headlining to being like superstars yes because of of an amazing special netherland like ali wong  crushes it yeah and then overnight huge star yeah so like back in the day i would do a netflix special for free sure yeah like if you were smart you would and you just go hit it on the road people used to hit me up and go because they thought it was like my friend at netflix and they would go hey can you call someone there and tell them that i'll pay to be on i'm like it doesn't work i can't be like hey my friend will give you 20 grand to be on the platform but that person was lowkey smart yeah yeah because if it's a billboard yes right and the people are going to see it so and then i noticed what was happening is like i did that netflix special and i was like i think this is really good and like we saw like a little bump but it wasn't crazy uhhuh and we were like really  hard on that i'm sure we  killed ourselves and i was like hmm if i just kept putting this on instagram or youtube we probably would have grown more like is something changing like what's going on wow and then i think what it is is like youtube can be honest with the algorithm because they don't make  yeah that's interesting everything netflix makes is 90 yeah when they see how many people liked it right you look like what are the reviews 90 people liked it yeah right it's like that's impossible of course right but youtube can be like nobody likes this yeah yeah right yeah and youtube can also be like everyone likes andrew tate yeah right because you  do yeah and then so i saw that kind of move and i was like okay this is kind of where the  people are and this this really worked out and i think that's why you saw so many guys that are putting out the youtube specials having this you know i know great like it is in their career  fanta like i i couldn't think of like i think about i'm just a few years older than when it was really something to consider but like for me it was um i did i'd done an album right i think i recorded it in 09 and it came out in 2010 and i tried to get a special in 2012 and they were like ah they you know because i've done comedy central presents yeah and they go well um they said they'll you're gonna get one but just like not right now but i had an hour and i was like no i want to put it out now so albums were still pretty popular yeah you could still do well with an album so i i did the thing where i just went you know what i'm gonna hire an engineer and a photographer for the uh artwork like it's a simpler thing yeah but then i put it on a service that puts it on i so i just didn't have a partner yeah so then all the checks would come to me yeah yeah and i was like oh and then people would go you know you could have done this with like warner brothers like it'd be in the same place yep like they would you know it's just being able to say warner brothers did it or how many central records did it well the internet makes sense great equalizer absolutely you know what's interesting what you're saying too is i'm learning this now because there are people on tick tock i'm obsessed with tick tock um that have millions of followers and are not standup comedians but now they are selling out venues so they're ticktock stars first and then come and see me do something over the weekend which is fine yeah but who knows how much that audience they'll retain because maybe their live show is not as strong yeah you get one lick you do one like but here's the interesting thing now i feel and i my sense is that because the clubs aren't fostering feature acts as much anymore that stand up is becoming like this dying thing and i feel like we in the future we're going to have to be like viral stars first and then stand up second that's interesting i i'm like yeah i see what you're saying where like there's less maybe grooming of the young talent there really is there's not like new york you guys have a little different view of things because of the new york system yeah we're like kind of caught in that bubble well yeah there's like you know 12 clubs or something and like everyone can do spots you can also live as a comedian in new york yeah doing spots that's the thing a lot of people don't realize they don't realize you can make a living doing spots you can't do that i went to la they gave me a check once with coins in it yeah it was seven dollars and fifty cents and i had two quarters right and i was like no i'm good bro like just give it to the bartender they're like no this is your money you earned this it's okay yeah no but like most of america is that yeah is that way where you're like no you need to like foster this young talent like have them develop clubs don't have feature act anymore where they'll put them up for the weekend and pay you peanuts they're not doing it that's true and that's like that's if you have access to the clubs like if you're in a big city you can start putting your stand up on tick tock and you start building that up but you're saying if you're in a city that only has one club and people are bringing their features in there's a head there's nothing to support them there's no yeah and also the clubs aren't like when i started featuring they were like all right you're you know they came through like you can work like these 15 clubs yeah yeah it's like well okay like that's how i'll get better at this and they're not even really doing that anymore not because they're not like we'll put you up they're like no we sold our condo yeah you figured it out well it's the same pay yeah yeah it's like it's like hookers like still get a dollar yeah strippers or whatever like it's the same there's like no inflation at this stroke but but what i'm saying too is that why would a club help out the feature act or whatever and the headliner and give the feature act the sunday night when they can just book a tick tock star who sells out for a week yeah because at the end of the day they're an incentive yeah they're a bar restaurant they're trying to fill it up that's what they care about the live experience is almost like a meet and greet and that's something that's kind of existed that way like like we love standup right so we enjoy giving the crowd the best night of their life that's something that we kind of like came up i imagine we all probably watch similar comics growing up we're like i want to  crush like that i want people wheezing whatever it is right yeah but the the audience i think a lot of times wants to just be there with you and be in the same room with this person they look up to they listen to every single week that's really exciting the amazing show is almost like icing on the cake yeah for most if you're a diehard comedy fan that's one thing but if you're the average fan they probably just like i want to be in the room i want to feel that experience and i want to maybe i can't shake hands but i'll get close i'm 20 feet away yeah and i think that's why the tick tock star works one time and then after you go and you're like oh he's way funnier on ticktock yeah or she's way more interesting on ticktock i don't really think that i need to go see that again i met her done done yeah i think that's why like there might be a wave of this and then it doesn't happen again because they tell you know the first rule you learn about when you start selling tickets they're like yeah it's about selling tickets next time yeah you want people to build back to the show i think louis said i think this is louis so i got it he was like every great show buys you one bad show yeah something like that right like you crushing vancouver they're coming back next time you're in vancouver yeah but you gotta he also said uh what's the stay on that bed what's the best   uh he goes what's the best thing someone can say after your uh shows are over um on the weekend right when are you coming back no all right i couldn't get tickets so he was like be real careful about how many shows you add because he's like what you want is for people to be like  yeah yeah you've got to get them next time yeah yeah and then immediately they're buying tickets yes next time you know what that now they go they go i tried to see him yeah he just put it on like yeah yeah that that's the i don't know that's the fire thing that i always like admired about like the touring comedians is like you really know how many people  with you yeah yeah you know what i'm saying like there's no there's no like money area like there are people who are maybe like more institutionally famous if you will they're on like big shows but like they tour and it's real light yes and it's like because you're the player on the team that people like yeah like they're players on the knicks that i i like because they're on the knicks right and if they get traded they could  die yeah do you know what i'm saying and i think i think that's a lot of people maybe that are on these like institutions you have like an snl it's like how much do people  with you how much do people  with the show right and that's yeah and that's the thing like the scary thing about putting out the special like this but also like the kind of fun thing is like i'll i'll know my number of like worth right you know what i mean like like i literally know the number that i should be paid to do comedy you know that's another gross term i learned from a promoter is that they go they go this is going to sound like like you know kind of gross to you but they go when we are in like promoter meetings we say like uh you know like uh what about schultz and then someone will go what's he worth and that means like what is what is how do we what is your value yeah what is your value to me like we just talked about you guys like how much does this steak cost yeah like what's he worth what is he  about to work and is it worth the whole weekend or whatever yeah just like whatever well it depends on the type like yeah the mark so it's like well he's worth 10 000 seats here or something or they're like he's worthless yeah you're just you're just an animal to them yeah yeah yeah i'm a cam girl yeah yeah but dude this i was telling you about this you're  you have the special like we just said to be clear we're recording this a few days before it comes out but this uh episode comes out a few days after so you can still go you can go to the andrew schultzcom and watch the special but the story about this first of all i would say this when your tour was going on you're probably you're definitely the best marketer of your shows because i would see your clips where i'd be like what in the  is happening like there's like like  gun like goddamn shirt cannons and then people dancing on stage i'm like this is a show right this is like a full experience and i got great guys that work with me on all this stuff yeah you know you guys know what it is you know build a business you need great people you need great people absolutely but like it was like like a super fun show and then you you made a deal like uh like we all hope to do for specials your special was acquired and then um afterwards i mean this is a story that i saw even on instagram they reach out to you and they're like we want you to cut a couple jokes out yeah because we just feel like there's going to be backlash we don't really want to deal with it so how about you edit this yeah i mean was your response immediate or did you like did you have a thing where you're like i got to think about this like what are they i want to know what the jokes were yeah and i wanted to know like what the lines were because like look i know it's  it's edgy and i understand like when you're doing a a special with a network you're not like you're entertaining their whole audience yeah and some of their audience like kids shows some of their audience likes like serial killer documentaries like if it's my youtube page it's like everybody who goes there knows what they're getting so you can't really be that upset unless i put out something shitty on my youtube page yeah be upset sure so i understand like their limitations i don't even like hate the streamers in any way like i understand like you you don't care as much about standup as i do i love this sure you love building a business that's awesome you have kids in  school you don't want them to not be able to go to school you have a new house like i empathize with you but at the same time i'm not gonna edit the jokes because i know more than you that people like them right you you think people might not like them yeah i know they like them yeah like a hundred percent mmhmm so they came in they're like okay there are these lines and i'm like i don't really think that that's bad there's like a there's the abortion joke that they were a little worried about there was a line i thought was so  silly that was really funny it was um a harry potter reference i just fetus delete us is the thing and i just thought it was like they're saying delete that yeah yeah they were like that's they i don't know why the  that they thought maybe there's it's like um making it too childish or something i don't know what the  it is it was a very weird line that's so weird and i was like and that is just so silly and then there was other like chunks there's like a a chunk about like ted bundy there's another like michael jackson chunk and then his wheelhouse he loves yeah so cool guys okay yeah he misunderstood knucklehead yeah yeah right yeah it was the women's fault for a hundred percent a hundred percent first of all yeah yeah i mean look he's a good looking he's smart all right he yeah he's right he failed out a lot he didn't fail out of law school but he could have been a good lawyer yeah and if you weren't being such a   yeah you know dumping him because he's like catch he's a good catcher back in the day an educated man like that that handsome and naturally handsome this is before people could fix their teeth or their face like eyebrows it was hot dude yeah yeah yeah yeah so like there's a little creepy in the stairs feelings behind his eyes but i mean yeah you know the guy loves to read who doesn't like a good reader true true true yeah 100 yeah yeah 100 i agree completely misunderstood they were not feeling it and uh they were not and um so you just sold me my ticket right now yeah yeah that's my wheelhouse bro but this here's the thing this has okay you told that story and it's so funny it's like the simplicity of posting that story it really is like you post it on instagram yeah kind of makes the right like people see it yeah and now you know it's been up at the point you're seeing this but people are buying tickets to see it i go to dinner last night big movie producers one of them goes uh you know we're just like talking about general things and he goes uh oh do you know andrew schultz and i go yeah and he goes i just read this thing um this story is fascinating to me so he tells the whole story yeah and the the other guy who he's like i don't know who they started he looks you up and he's like oh yeah i think i've seen this guy he tells them the story about the special and how they wanted to edit it and he goes so they bought it back and dude and the other guy goes oh i'm buying a ticket to that right now he goes and he goes and he buys the ticket you know because i feel like people who a love comedy and b hate censorship and any type of like a corporation telling you you cannot do this yeah man they're just getting behind it for the love of both like love of comedy and like and pushing back against well and isn't this what we're talking about at the top before you arrived is this is such a  hollywood thing yeah yeah andrew andrew we love you let me guess how that conversation went yeah here's the money there's just one little thing could you just change who you are yeah but it's worse it's worse than that because it's at first it's you know what here's the money do whatever you want yeah like you know i mean it's it's not like that they're like hey make sure when you record yes and what happens is of course but culture changes that's the crazy thing you can't control culture changes so it's like the chappelle trans thing happened right and i think companies got  terrified because they're like oh  this is the backlash that a company is getting because of a comedian to a joke and if the biggest guy on the planet gets that backlash yeah what is a less big guy going to get so so that's the situation they're in so it's like oh you changed your mind yeah you changed your mind you thought it was fine before and now it's different you didn't know that this is something that can happen but we changed our minds but what is quote but let's think about this what is the great backlash real truly yeah it's not is it this narrow community of  crybaby  yeah who are just looking to complain about some  yeah and it really should be the corporation's duty to go like okay enough nonsense let's get up the majority of people are on board with chappelle i'll tell you exactly who it is many women cis women have the capacity for pregnancy many cis women do not have the capacity for pregnancy there are also trans men who are capable of pregnancy as well as nonbinary people who are capable of pregnancy so this isn't really a women's rights issue it's uh we can recognize that this impacts women while also recognizing that it impacts other groups those things are not mutually exclusive senator hawley oh so your view is is that the core of this i love this guy so i want to recognize that your line of questioning is transphobic and it opens up trans people to violence but these are the these are the same lunatics who will go like dave hey dave chappelle you're putting people in danger with your with your joke i'm like wait what yeah what are you talking about yeah what is happening yeah that's that's the tricky thing is my boy my boy charlemagne you guys know charlemagne yeah charlemagne sent me that clip and he was just like dying laughing he's like nah this is too far and i was like i was like buddies like we tried to storm the capitol man it's like this is what happens when you stop us yeah do you know what i mean like we try yeah i feel like you're looking at me like i really tried yeah yeah yeah you talked to the fbi afterwards yeah wait a minute sorry i didn't know you had a bigger beard i remember the viking helmet no um every guy that's on the capitol looked like me just was  like tinted shades oh it's so funny but yeah it's just ridiculous people aren't that upset and it's no no majority of people do not give a  i mean like you even yeah just about even like the the the chappelle situation that was obviously you know super annoying i think even like the trans community like you actually talk to trans people like i was able to talk to some trans people and like the trans community is actually really worried about like kind of getting like killed if they're on a date yeah like they're not worried about swimming yeah like i was talking to a kind of shoes like we don't even that's annoying to us sure because it shifts the focus yeah and we kind of got to support her because she's one of us but in reality we want to be like  quit swimming so we could not get killed when we go out on a date right you know what i mean yeah sure yeah are you helping that's true like are those people truly helping that community but what's fascinating about being cancelled in cancel culture is that it seems like because i've been doing a little experiment on twitter um where i tweet stuff i'm just like what's going to ruffle feathers today and it really is just about what's in the zeitgeist yeah is the feathers you're going to ruffle on that particular outrage is currency yeah yes and like currency and like outrage has a hierarchy that's something i learned through this too is like i put out that like thing where i was talking about what happened the special yeah and like obviously comics and community supported and like people who you know know me they support it and then i put out later the the feed is the leaders clip and i dropped that like whole abortion piece it's like a longer piece and like that's what the media picked up on right it was a trifecta of like comic censorship abortion yeah like it was all three were enough buzzwords exactly and i saw something like interesting it was like yeah i didn't know if conservatives were like religious first or conservative first right and and i i saw a lot of them be like listen jokes got to be jokes you got to be able to joke about abortion that's a touchy subject especially right now yeah yeah and then a lot of conservatives were just like yeah we can't do this censorship  and i thought it was really interesting i was like ooh okay that that is that more important than god yeah yeah now let me ask you this when that all stuff dropped did your presales go oh yeah yeah i mean like it was people were very people very into it and that's the trickiest thing about even like marketing is like i they a lot of like different political sites want me to go on and i like people not knowing where i lie yeah that to me is like the best thing about being a comedian is i i want you to have no  clue like the abortion piece i put out you see the comments like both sides kind of feel heard yeah and that's odd yeah which is a great place to be right i don't want you to know how the  i feel about it because i'm loyal to the jokes yeah i care about jokes like if i was a political activist i'd go do that yeah like that kind of comedy annoys me sure do you know what i mean because it's just like you don't really care about that you want people to it's just your message yeah exactly so like for me i gotta say no to certain articles or magazines i know i could  probably run numbers up if i just leaned into that cozy position sure but then they're going to mascot me and then i can't do the jokes i want to do no you don't want to do that exactly and you see people do that they just like fold into the comfort like once you're ostracized yeah they fold into the comfort oh we were just talking about some people you know very well oh really well yeah who like in it because people do that where they they get cast aside by and then they have to find some somebody to embrace them or a group to him it's lonely being alone yes of course so it's like i see how they do it and it's cozy when everybody's supporting you yeah but if you want to do this for a long time you kind of got to be true to the thing you're doing yeah you got to really character yeah that's my loyalty to the jokes like just run it up like let's let's make fun of everybody and then that's always the ethos of the show like it's everybody's going to get these you know that the other friends so you mentioned uh like this when they go like don't punch down it sparked this memory where i did this interview once we were talking about this guy was talking about my special he was like yeah you know this and that and that and his comment then he goes and i guess you know the whole thing is just uh don't be a dick right and i was like no no no no sometimes being a dick's the funniest thing it is and some of the most famous comedians are like you would go like that guy's a dick yeah like who made korea like you can be like oh ricky gervais is a dick like the  such a funny  guy but like he's a dick right like tosh like first he played all the time like the  his whole thing was like i am a so i just i remember that that's like a don't be a dick in real life yes that is a good rule yeah but some if you're going what's the funniest thing to say here sometimes the funniest thing to say is something that is  rude yeah and insensitive that's what's always funny it's the impulse humor's not right yeah no right like take my wife please that's not right right but it's in deep down you had a feeling right and i think that's what people confuse it's like what we're saying we know are lies yeah a lot of times but they're the funniest version yeah absolutely and if you could just separate that from truth like i did this talk with these like um these uh like intellectual dudes you know how they always try to bring us in to like what does comedy mean yeah what is our purpose in society are we taking shows the truth and i'm like dude no yeah i don't even want to be on stage with you guys like you guys say things are true i talk about my dick in the funniest way possible that's it that's it like don't give me the expectations of a politician yeah give me the expectations of comedian yeah like the lowest possible sure is this going to be a funny thing yeah yeah because i i put my eclipse and bundy's misunderstood yeah he's so much funnier yeah then he's a bad man yeah of course like we know that's not true but a little part of us is like 50 yeah yeah some of those women probably right like yeah like 50 i mean here's the thing they weren't here's okay none of them deserve to die i literally have a line and the special they deserve to die okay i'm just saying this it is definitely possible that not all of them were good people you know what i mean like like there's some two a few of them were like this is you know who got murdered and somebody was like i'm not gonna miss her yeah this is comedy can we justify the worst thing yes this is it this is all we do don't put us on a  pedestal you know melissa was kind of a  right yeah i'm sure he didn't pick good people this is what happened with a few one a few were good a few were good probably okay let's give you all we're good right like even if that i was watching it with my wife and this is what the  the joke was it was like he was driving a tan volkswagen beetle and that  and like the line he would get to get the girls in he would be like he'd be like hey my car's broke down can you help me fix it yes and i'm like this worked i'm like what i was like they all deserved it like every single one like the worst car yeah broken and a lady is going to help you fix it what straight woman knows how to fix a car in 1970 yeah that's so stupid i don't know  about so like to me and i'm obviously i'm infuriating my wife as i'm like you know she's sitting there like yeah you know this is horrible this is gutwrenching this could happen to me and i'm just like why would they fix it they don't know how to fix cars why would they even go i don't fix cars yeah yeah i'm like why does this loser you can't afford a mechanic there was a  that's why you're alive yeah you  stupid get out of here you put his arm in a castle oh that one's a good one and he'd have books and he's like can you help me carry these books  you curious the one girl helped him carry the books and then he pulled out a club and he clubbed her and then she said to him are you are you supposed to help me with my spanish homework like she said that to him and when he told that story he told that story when he was on death row to the fbi investigation no they didn't he  yeah he's like what a dummy right i'm gonna kill her she thinks i'm a spanish tutor yeah he was a real goofball that guy he did have a good sense of humor he had a sense of humor yeah we found about a lot of these guys funny guys funny guys guys funny guys yeah but what happened when people like why do people think that standup has become a ted talk like jon stewart you think so the great johnson he was so good that i think it warped people's idea of what comedy is he really he was so prolific at like here's how good he is republicans loved him yeah yeah that's when yeah it's true he couldn't be more like progressive and like goodnatured big heart um i i feel like i could do the right thing person who people like absolutely disagreed with and they're like i  love that because he's authentic he's pure he's a pure guy he's still fighting for and he's so smart though yeah like to be at that level if you want ted talk funny and have it be legit funny actually funny not like you're clapping because you're gross yeah he's so smart yeah jesus christ hit it thank you hit it where's too bundy he liked brunettes right yeah no i yeah that's the thing i always think about that like sometimes like uh generations expectation of comedy is shifted by one person i'm sure it happened like with us with our parents etc yeah you know they saw like i remember my dad telling me about listening to pryor yeah on a record for the first time just at a party and they were just playing it people listen to comedy at parties yeah just been probably laughing and drinking right yeah just like hanging out but like that now is your expectation so now you can digest the wild stuff if he's the person i think i think john was just so prolific and the show was so popular that i think a lot of people started to go oh comedy can be right and funny yeah and and i also think yes and i agree and i think that some comedians when they get really really really popular stop making jokes and they become the mashiach and now everything they say is just  uh brilliant nadav loves when i incorporate hebrew into my language um a great a great example of this who i absolutely adore was bill hicks and towards the end of his life a lot of those jokes became ted talks wait what where what are we doing here i think that's why younger generations don't get carlin yeah like if yeah you know what i mean like because they didn't see the evolution of carlin like even with chappelle now like the kids don't know chappelle show they don't know their earlier specialties that's right you know even like in their 20s so they're just going in to this special yeah and they're going okay or this guy this guy's doing a lot of talking he's saying these great stories and he can hold attention like masterfully unbelievable but the expectation is not maybe met for them because we're going oh no that guy's the best yeah ever like ever because we saw for what it's worth yeah you know what i mean like we saw all these specials leading up to it so that's the thing about that's thing about like the you youth is undefeated bro like yeah yeah you know what i mean like youth is gonna change perception and they don't know all the things that you did your entire career so like you're fighting for it every time you go on stage yeah and i kind of i love that i like like i don't know there's certain guys that it feels like every time they're trying to prove themselves like that's kind of what i want to do is like every time i want a reason that you become like an activist on stage though is because you don't have the same pressure that you felt intuitively before you had huge success to be funny right and so like when no one knows you remember you go to a spot you're like your whole thing is like i just i want to do great i want to kill right yeah you're trying to convince people who have no idea who you are that you're funny yeah and then like when you get a huge following everyone's like you're really funny yeah you have to put that pressure on yourself yes because it's not they're not going to be like yeah you know are you funny they're like no you are funny yeah so then you have to manufacture the pressure that's why that's why like insecurity is your greatest asset i feel yes as a comic and like i'm not talking about like the crippling insecurity where like you need your friends to tell you you're great every  day yeah i'm talking about like you see the joke and you're like i could do that better or yes that's hacky or this ideas and it's not even fully formed yet yes because that i hopefully will stop you from putting out the work that is a little bit watered down version yes of what you did yes you know yeah and loki that i think that's also why i wanted to i mean not to harp on the special but like i didn't want to put it out because like i have the little that in the back of my head like i didn't want to be like the guy who did the comedy the exact way i wanted and then the second i do the special they see a watereddown version of it and it's like yeah you don't wanna do that  that like i that then it becomes an easy decision right because you're just like oh i'm not gonna i'm not going to sacrifice the integrity of the comedy yeah so it's cause that's the thing i value the most that of course i don't know i don't feel and maybe i don't know maybe i never felt like i don't feel like the the check mark validates me or like the the logo that puts out the special validates me yeah as much as i do like selling tickets validates yeah and maybe that's because that's my sign of success in the business i didn't have that as much you know early on sure but like you know doing shows and having them sell out feels great because it's like  got a babysitter they put on clothing yeah you know what i mean like that is like real support and for me i like that you know they're wearing clothing that's awesome this ain't the relapse tour  yeah i don't know so for me like no it is yeah that's that's the best you know the thing is like because people i'm doing a tour that's so aggressive thing we got to talk about this i know it's so crazy but they tell me they're like how do you like how do you get amped up how do you get amped up like on you know the  ninth show of the week or something and i go you know the thing that always like sometimes you're like jesus christ you know i'm just like so worn out yeah it is actually opening instagram and seeing what you're tagged in and you see people are like we're going inside and they're so excited and you go okay let them down i gotta yeah and it immediately no matter how much you're dragging you're like you see like a few of those and you're like oh i gotta that's this is what they're looking forward to which is just like garth it's just like garth and then you see everything yeah yeah you point to them and you say hello susan from wichita see you yeah yeah no but you want to talk to you no i feel that it's exciting to go back to another garth brooks concert is like you blew you blew them out of the waters a special experience yeah how do you explain what is that what is that special experience that people are getting i wish i knew because i don't feel like it's anything crazy i just feel like there's a connection that's nice because when i go try to remember before you ever step on stage you're a fan and so we still go to concerts make sure we just went to bruno we went to urban jt and in those moments when you're in that crowd all you want is that artist to look at you for three seconds and you can go hey man thanks for your music it's been cool and as an entertainer it's the same thing that's exactly how i feel uh you know could you imagine referring to to your act like first name like we saw andrew oh yeah we saw dave yeah we saw joe yeah that's just so like and i'm a man i'm a fan for and i just start weeping like i remember but i love coffee bruno but how weird for him to just say the the the only one of them williams i mean he knows you know he's like these are my peers urban also he knows that even though he looks like he changes tires that he sells so many more tickets than those guys so many people i mean yeah we'll talk about currency yeah yeah dude yeah he  sells out stadiums in like 45 minutes yeah and i don't think he even has his music online to stream yeah right so crazy dude it's like amazon or something right he has his own deal for that yeah he's got it but he's got it he's got it and he's got cool things i don't know like i i try to take as much inspiration from like the the music world for shows and stuff yeah but like what is that that one song will help play the third verse live rolling thunder so yeah he has one where like there's a third verse but the only time you get to hear it is live so he's like baking things into the live experience like oh i want to have that i want to how is this different from being at home that's cool the only thing i've heard from people because we've been talking about him for a while is that you guys have a lovely uh relationship is that his live show is epic i mean i've only heard that i've ne i've only have you not gone i've never gone are you banned i don't know if i'm allowed in i mean there's no way they'll be able to tell you apart from you just walk backstage and they'll be like i'll see you sir uh yeah i miss you i heard i heard it's it's a  unbelievable show so what are we waiting for let's go let's go i'll go i'll go should we go we should get a section yeah we should get a your mom's house section like how do we get 300 tickets yes and it's just one entire  section is great that is a fantastic idea forget buying cars with bert yeah yeah like just by one dude if you want to troll this guy and then everybody takes off their shirt and it's a i don't know what what are the bodies garth yes yeah and then it's just up front everybody else has like a shirt of bundy or gay or something and they're like you're in the club like pointing to shirts this is a fantastic idea yeah it's a really good idea buy like a thousand seats in an area you know there's just like a hole i know you're listening to this make it happen i honestly think that you guys should do this i think it's a great idea i mean that is like national news yeah it's so goddamn funny even if he doesn't like it his fans have to like it they'll like it he doesn't like it yeah he won't like it he's gonna be furious yeah and then we start busting out the signs you know everybody give my mother back all that stuff what's that how do we turn the audience how do we get them to sing yeah like who's who's his rival right oh interesting that's true play blah blah blah it's not even his songs like the whole section starts going get like get out of the genre completely play and vote this is going to go horribly wrong and i just feel i'm regretting to suggest no that's a great idea such a good idea and just to inspire fans like to wear these shirts to the car that i see all the time yeah i see people they're trolling him with your guys they wear our stuff to the shows and they're out and they'll take the picture and there's even one of me in the shirt like it looks like him it's just me um and it's just like a total copy of his shirt like they yeah he does i don't know i'm just fascinated by the guy he's he's like this genuine sincere like emote he cries in this yeah in this interview right here he cries he's country music tom cruise yeah oh yeah yeah that's what it is very good yeah yeah he's like insulated completely totally totally yeah right there his exact copy of one of his shirts yeah that's fire that's funny cease and desist or no no nothing yet nothing yet good for him but i did find out that he knows about it because i met a promoter okay whose family member is like works with him every day close with him and so the promoter said he goes i'm with my family member i don't try not to sell who it is and they he goes you know he knows the promoter he goes who are you working with this weekend and the promoter goes uh tom sagura and that guy goes you're gonna work with that  and he goes yeah he's i'm doing his show and he goes you know he's she's such a jerk uh saying all this serial killer  about garth and so the promoter goes he said he goes i knew about it but i acted like i didn't and he goes what are you talking about he goes oh he's just he's just mean for no reason and then the promoter said does garth know and he goes yeah he knows and he goes is he mad at huh or does he hate tom and the guy goes garth doesn't hate anybody oh he hates you yeah yeah yeah yeah that's the southern bless her heart how do we get you guys to reconcile and then like he brings you out for your next special i you know like this guy with the i would love to be like interviewing him oh my god he has no  clue oh it would be amazing yeah that would be the dream would you can't you do that can't you pretend be pressed like can we do a ymca got everybody and you can definitely get garth yeah he's got to throw in a hat right yeah no you got that that's you got to apply to be press for whatever junket he's doing next and you are technically depressed you guys are journalists yeah i think we should babe but i'm i'm wondering if there's like a way where you guys can kind of come together yeah i mean can you can you guys make a country song like can you oh my god here's the thing i feel like guys make the number one country song he just has to sit there and listen to it every time he gets in the car it would be so i wish that he could he could make this so fun just by leaning into it like if one time you know we've made fun of people who their immediate response is like yep and they lean into it and then everybody just everybody i love this person yeah and if he would just be like you know the bodies are in my in my ranch you know yeah everybody would lose their  mind yeah but i don't think he will i think we should do a country song maybe we could have wheeler help us oh wheeler oh wheeler help us out yeah that'd be great yeah i mean dude imagine really so much for your next  your next tour it's just you doing a promo like normal it's almost like corny yeah and in the background like blurry you see somebody just digging a hole yeah and it's him yeah like it's actually him ain't jokes in here yeah dude that would be a mate can you imagine if he would do a promo with me i mean why not he's got all the money you can't motivate him with money no you can only motivate him with a good time sure and but also he doesn't know what like the real world like he's too famous too crazy so he needs somebody to tell him like hey you know what you should do man you should do this thing with this guy everyone's going to love it garth and he's like everybody already loves me exactly it's like that time where he decided to come on facebook and let the conversation begin and if you saw that right hold on if we could get his pr guy to convince him that he's he's opening a bigger conversation with the podcasting world yeah there's got to be a way i'm going to see if i can do this on this oh my god whatever it's the great how do you want to tell it's what started it's the greatest so it is what started i got it it's the very first clip we saw him talking you've never seen this and we're like what is this dude it's so weird this is one of the best i have a theory and see if you agree with me after you watch it yeah okay yeah i don't want to tell you anything but this put your headphones on yeah this this is a holy  dude this is how this started okay so he wasn't on social media and then he okay well i guess it's official we're now on facebook i really wasn't sure about this at the start but then a friend of mine said something that just made all kinds of sense she said think of it more as a conversation i like that but i'm already finding out on my own so it's wiping the walls out between you and me and i really like that it allows us into each other's worlds or i guess in my case a hotel room when i think about things i want to post i want to post cool stuff slick stuff neat stuff no no no no no no no stuff i'm gonna post is gonna be raw stuff like this raw stuff like this this is just who i am so if this is truly a conversation then i say let the conversation begin so that was his introduction to social media and that's why we first played him we were like what the  was that you know so andrew okay so here's the deal at first i was like this guy's off there's something inauthentic i'm not reading it it doesn't read yeah i think he might be on the spectrum oh because he's mimicking human emotion at times he has emotions that are like inappropriate like i've seen elon musk who came out having us as bears is so i don't think it's drugs or mental illness i think he's autistic and i think he's mimicking what he thinks a great country singer would you be like in real life yeah why are we so drawn to autistic people because they can mimic what the expectations of a person are meaning he studied probably what he thinks a person should be like and then he goes okay here's where i laugh let the conversation that's why it's all off there's no there's no room for error because it's not spontaneous well this is like a great example of like so i'm still like reacting from that right yeah you're like i want to give like a witty fun response yeah right but i'm like how many years of living in a complete bubble do you have to have before you can do something like that with like zero embarrassment right like  right like i'm almost a little like sad yeah because and also like that's what this show does to you andrew you know he's right if you don't leave here feeling sad we didn't do it this is not your mom's it's your mom's house guys feel sad and also the hotel room the hotel room it's dark as  he doesn't turn a light and the whispers like it was a sexy voice he goes yeah i like that the conversation began yeah it's like he's coming out yeah like it felt like that a little bit like they said it's a little while that's exactly let's give it a try yeah he was coming out he's getting rid of those walls uh he's letting you in this guy someone told him facebook just means you're gay yeah and he was like i'll do the video i'm gonna do the video i'm gonna come out and i bet you they'll still come to the concerts dude and they still are business it's the  cringiest thing i've ever seen but notice too he's always talking about wiping the walls away communicating getting closer to the fans because i think he knows that's what fans want so he's thinking from backwards he's thinking from the outside in this one you know what i mean this is the irresponsibility it's calculated because he was like that person who was like this is what people are doing g yeah you know he was like uh all right and he's like i like that and like so he did what he's like maybe they'll like what i just did the ukraine one that was the weirdest you've got to see that yeah put your headphones on for this one buckle up because this one just has it's a it's a plea to to raise fundraising but it has one moment where you're always like like why did you think and then why did you air this why didn't you do a take two right hey everybody garth brooks and trisha irwin and we're proud to say we stand with ukraine especially the refugees there's a global initiative and of course supplies and aid is already spread then and this is where you come in we need your help we need you to donate yeah i mean we always ask for love and prayers please keep doing that we're also going to ask you dig in your pockets be part of the greatest global relief plan mankind has ever seen everybody deserves dignity everybody deserves a roof over their head to feel safe you can be a part of that yeah amen so join us won't you stand up for love stand up for mankind stand up for ukraine why did he laugh there i i i just can't get over is that his wife yeah yeah wow just a shocking resemblance to shane gillis like a an absolute shocking resemblance i can't i honestly i tuned out the whole thing i tuned out because everything going on here so is that a kaepernick hat definitely not that's would be that would be shocking but seven is cap's number right i think you're right um for sure that's like how many  notre dame stadiums he sold or something i don't know what it is okay oh it has something to do with like him and he's i'm sure yeah um i mean but there's a little laugh at the end there he goes stand up stand up for humanity and stand up for ukraine like what the  just happened there oh he's out of it huh yeah he just doesn't know what's happening disconnected guys i'm telling you and also when he does this politician thing the greatest humanitarian effort that's what that's what obama was doing it's the same politician he's mimicking what people act like and there's nothing spontaneous you know what maybe it's creepy you know like you can't stop watching the show love on the spectrum you can't just stop observing them and they're just fun to just watch because you never know what's going to happen and like you know it's going to be like pure honesty like yeah and you know like yeah the  like even the people who are good reality stars yeah they they require a little bit they require a little like lack of selfawareness yeah do you know what i'm talking about that's what i have yeah well you might be good at reality i was on road rules back in the 90s wait really what season season six australia mate with whom um peggy chadwick the guy who got like the burns or whatever he got like cuts in his arm he like um he had a tiger tattoo over his heart because this girl broke his heart um susie meister and um well we were like really young it's a million years ago i'm trying to remember the cast but you know the people are really good are the ones that like psychos yeah they're psychos but they're like they have to be kind of funny but they can't really be aware about how embarrassing they are yeah yeah and that's why you can't look away because you're like oh my god you're going to cause a problem in this situation and not give a flying  that's why it's so good like jersey shore was so good it was amazing yeah that that show was  incredible like people people act like it's a joke now like snooki was like a punch line for sure but like it was appointment television it really was yeah you didn't i mean if you missed it you're like we gotta like yeah i want to see these because i felt like caricatures these cartoons yeah yeah i just tell you a lot of celebrities come to the comedy store and the night paulie d showed up was the greatest night of my life don't care about the big ones you know jennifer ant who cares yeah it was paulie d like just he was backstage and i was like that was just like normal to me like i have   um hey so did you grow up in the city yeah you did so you're a new york kid yeah and you you love hiphop right yeah you grew up yeah yeah so they they suggested this and i think it's a good idea okay i used to play this game with a lot of guests okay called uh no you're not let's go let's go because you're a hiphop head yeah i am but this isn't a hiphop game okay it's just uh it's really gonna make me say a word we shouldn't say it seems like we're going in that direction it's about having a tuned ear is what it's about ah so you have to put those on again i'm sorry um but the game is called ear spell er the game andrew is called tom or black and what it is it's an audio clip and then you just tell me if it's me or a black guy or a black guy yeah gotcha that's it and these are they're just short clips you can play them you can ask for repeats yep and then it's just you know you just and if i guess the actual black guy what happens there so wait we'll just we'll we'll go in order okay and then um when we're done with it we'll just reveal the answers yep yeah yep um and if you actually know the black eyes name that'd be great that's a bonus point we'll give you two points if you can name the black if i can name the black person 100 got it ready go here we go now i got this this is the easiest thing i've ever done okay here we go here we go okay first of all i know the exact video it's from country ass town pollen right that's the reporter the black reporter no that's you i'm not saying who it is i'm just saying that it's i know what video you think this is and this is not that is eric let me hear it one more time  with my ass man such a great great  with my ass man i'm gonna say black guy okay yeah okay all right uh moving on i thought i had that one did you mark it thank you yeah um god damn it god damn it do they have black people in love on the spectrum is there a black guy on that show are black guys autistic wow that's a really good it's gonna be are asians autism i didn't know that there was no i'll be honest with you i didn't know that they had um  down syndrome in other countries i know you don't really see them i'm being i'm not cause like you know you've never like you've never been in venice and you see one on like a bridge or something like that like but i think it might be an american thing well i remember the first time i saw an asian person you thought that it was i was just like oh right like you're the first asian person i've seen i always saw white kids like because you grew up in in ohio in ohio in minneapolis like you just see white kids yeah at school or not at school but the grocery store you grew up in jew dirk city so there must be a lot of there's i thought it was only jews i asked my dad when i was young i swear to god i asked my dad when i was in kindergarten i said why aren't we not jewish and my dad was like well you're schultz though you're not which is even more confusing imagine yeah everybody thinks i'm jewish i think you're jewish most people thought i was yeah i'm i'm not as far as i know right like you know so is schultz not it's technically german or russian actually okay okay but there's some people in the family that are like so you're connected you know might you know it wasn't great to be jewish at certain times so they might have switched it up oh right right right right yeah so who knows but um but yeah with the  down syndrome thing i i've never seen one abroad yeah i thought about that maybe i have to spend more time in other countries like i lived i i lived i used to live in spain i never saw a single one wow do you think they have abortions more readily maybe when they know it's going to be a cousin yeah yeah yeah yeah what city did you live in huh what city uh barcelona oh nice yeah yeah i believe it's barcelona well well well if you're a true catalan yeah it's barcelona oh wow i did not got their own language they got their own but you're right barcelona that's what that's what this is yeah i got rid of that list quick yeah if you come back here yeah yeah you can't do that  um okay what would i say who that was i think that's you hold on number three here we go yep they won't play we did say one more time give me that one time yep one more time come on second they won't play we did sean king that's sean king 100 okay next one you didn't cover the product that's you wow why you didn't even hesitate i like the immediate answers

trick you let me go home that is a city city in china 100 okay well those guys are having fun let me hear that one again oh yeah i can't imagine you giving that much effort in in anything so i'm going to say a black guy i just can't imagine you ah yeah i left a wallet there you cry he came through you even if it's not you it's funny if it's you don't compliment that  me  all right you did pretty well okay what have we got okay so this first one that you thought was the reporter yeah there's really a homeless guy laying on his back and he's saying  me in my ass man to an imaginary person fire yeah he's getting its homeless man gets raped by gay ghost you did say black so i was right your points 100 i knew i knew it was authentic i knew uh this one goddammit you said me there's actually a black guy who just finished having an orgasm in a porn i don't know if that's true dude yeah i i think you might be off on that one and it was his he actually says it in multiple it's like his uh it's his call sign he always goes goddammit yeah oh that sounded freakishly familiar yeah that's not me i swear uh the next one oh you said you named sean king okay we did yeah and that's me that was a really which is a sean king is what uh activist eddie a caucasian male 1 so technically i'm right with sean king okay i need points for that one you guys got to get sean king on the show oh man that'd be great i don't know if he would come on this show  you said that was me yep and that was the next one what were you even saying there you need to come to the party and then they've distorted this no there was no distortion that's you actually can get that high well i think i can't now i recorded it a few years ago it was something like that  okay the next one was that one you were close my dude you think that better not be you like yeah just lie whatever you do right now live yeah you said that was a city yes city and that is a black um get that right you got that right um yeah got that right man you got i think you only got one wrong so far wow good ear yeah new york city oh yeah yeah but this would never be my effort that's not so true that's not that's unchanged right he does other things like i'm coming to get that booty i'm coming at you that's fire i hate eggs this is what that homeless guy was thinking about yeah it is uh this one you said i left a wallet there you said that was me yep yeah and that was me doing a prank phone call that was good yeah that was good that was a pretty good one right yeah yeah and there's a whole phone call where i'm talking to uh a barber shop can i tell you what what gave it away yeah someone who left their wallet would never call it a wallet oh oh yeah you're right i left a wallet there i left my wallet yeah  you're right andre all these years literally we've had the only person that's ever said for a decade yeah and by the way i want to say something many many black people have gotten that wrong that's true what can i say old many black people um then this next one came through you said me correct yeah and then this last one don't compliment that  you said it was you yep correct you got all the one all but one wow what was the one i got wrong you got uh you got the sean sean king no you got two wrong or one wrong i might have got two this one uh zolos has two yeah i think the second i can't stop the second and third you're right uh sorry you got this wrong you got you got you got god damn it wrong god damn oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that was good and you're right so you got two wrong you got two wrong but are you good you're good with the accents and stuff i think i'm worse now because i haven't been practicing as much yeah there was a time on this podcast where he was known as the master of accents and he could replicate anything really yeah but you you know you have to work the muscle man yeah i haven't been doing it as much that's true tom listen don't be defensive my confidence is shocked no  no that was fun um all right that was so  great thank you yeah um i want to point out again that people have an opportunity right now how long do they get to stream it for forever forever yeah nice so once they what is it yeah they'll have like they have like a twoweek window to to to buy it and we might extend that after talking to you yeah but like uh once they get it then we'll also send them a link and they can just keep it in perpetuity oh that's nice because if they're gonna buy it they deserve to yeah you don't own it that's a good that's a good move and i also gotta say you guys were a huge inspiration for this because i saw you guys doing that over the pandemic you guys were doing the live shows yes and i remember after i filmed this special i met you guys for the first time at the paramount i remember yeah so we were filming that day before and then somebody's like yeah tom and christina are actually in the paramount right now go say hi and i was like i would like to meet them and i came and i saw you guys and then yeah i just saw you guys blow that live thing up and it really like i know louie has also sold his thing very yeah but i never knew how it did and so it was like for me i it was obviously inspirational to do that you know all credit to him for that but like when i saw you guys doing it and people saying how successful they were i was like oh

i'm just letting you know i asked him i said is anything off limits and he said just don't involve my kids oh yeah and that's it so i mean he's pretty much yeah he's a pretty controversial guy though he is harry he is he's he's shot what did he say at rolling loud we should probably know that but it was definitely a little edgy right i think it was something about sucking dick maybe yeah he was something about like sending like if you're something like get out of here if you're doing that if you're yeah we could find out he basically said like no gay  in the audience exactly yeah or in the in that wow i mean he was trying to kiss a fan and a fan wasn't into it apparently that's another viral thing i don't want to get on his bad side because i'm a huge fan bradley maybe you take the hardhitting ones this time okay so you never really go that route the baby's the one guy that would like scrap brad though eh yeah but you have a good  you're fine he would you have you feel like he scraps everyone that's like that's his thing like he gets him  i'm right beside him too bro yeah well just don't you mind he's trying to elbow you got to be the the bad guy this time you always try to be the good guy one time i'm not trying to be any guy i'm just the guy you're the  yo let me get really deep and connect with you just come on bro that's the tough ones  hater because i have to ask the tough ones i  hate it dude i'm scared what are you just this situation what are you scared of i think he's about that i hope i hope he comes with his bodyguard his body goes my homie is he kane yeah how do you know him uh  you know all the body guys i know all the bodyguards it's true now yeah we used to film videos back in the day too work out a little bit here and there who what bodyguards

working out during the training and they'll like find me because you know they're into that  on social and then i'll end up developing a relationship if they come to the gym a lot of them are in that area so they end up there so like all the guards who've worked with like drake all of them like  kim kardashian all that  do they juice or not yeah i feel like there's a huge what whatsapp for all the juice gym oh what's that yeah is there he's a what's by telegram yeah like a telegram something that's how you guys are all connected that's cool so how's miami uh uh not allah steve will do it you gotta have fun man yeah yeah you gotta buy new watches you can't wear the handmedowns steve took your watch yeah yeah okay he made me take it yeah that's  up bro like why do you have to do that not even on camera no not even on camera brad like in the back of his head he's like well do i need to get more steve will do it titles or not like do i need it that's what you're thinking now you now you're upgrading you got your own  yeah yeah doesn't it feel better to get like it does it does how much was i watch 15 000 a little more 18 yeah yeah i knew that i also know how much that chain was yeah it's i mean i don't want to talk about that yet yeah i'm waiting for the baby to talk about that okay i'll talk about it with him yeah i think this will be bigger than his uh i don't i don't think so what if he gets pissed about that i don't think he's gonna have a channel you want to make a bet let's make a bet right now let's make a bet okay one thousand a thousand bucks thousand bucks he's a chain on okay okay come check my hand any chain of any sort yeah well he can i'm talking about this yeah a thousand dollars and if he does i want to get paid right after the pod  this is tough i like your odds i think he's gonna i think he's coming on here to look humble okay yep boom but i'm going with that you really think so yeah and just send it to timepiece for my payment plan damn it bro yeah for the watch guys dropping there's nothing going on bro there's nothing going on i swear there's nothing going on hey is that how much you got no i was 18 bro the hoodie you get 15k for the hoodie i got nothing for the hoodie bro no i said oh here's a hoodie on the way out i said oh i have no clothes i'm gonna wear it that's dope you don't have a shirt on yeah it wasn't like official though but it was probably at like 20k and then he's like 18 bro and i'll rock the hoodie on that i only had one shirt it's the only that's what he does that's exactly the only shirt i had he's got the shirt just again no i don't know that's hilarious because earlier literally like 20 minutes before this pot i saw you wearing completely different outfit yeah but i showered before that you're a cat bro you're a  job dude shut up oh god i love it whatever shout out timepiece trading they're always taking care of us those are our boys they're dope straight up i'm gonna do that though that's the move is to get uh i know we're going back but to get a crazy like kung fu fighter security one just to have that nobody knows he's security but he's in the squad and he can   up just like just a sleeper like it would be lit to roll around around like with bruce lee bruce lee is in the squad but no one knows so man chris is the best he's a great security guard yeah i guess so the baby security guard is six nine this dude is  have you met the baby uh have you i don't think so i met him one time yeah we're at at the design district i asked him to come on the show this show yeah and what do you say he was like with his family he was like yeah get hold the security guard but it wasn't that guy because it wasn't that big but whoever he was with get the info we'll check it out never heard from him yeah i had to try how did this one come about um so i was  hammered in oc at this place called bungalow okay i heard it was a club and then uh this guy just walks up to me and he paid for my booth he paid for the table yeah we were leaving and he paid for the table he's like uh his name's tyler and he does the baby's uh merch and he does nba young boys merch rodman  so he's like a huge just huge clothing guy in oc yeah and then uh we were just connecting the next day i thanked him and  and then he said he told me that he does the baby  yeah and then i said uh he's like you want him on the pod i was like  yeah was this recent then it was like yeah it's pretty recent yeah probably like a week or two ago or less that's pretty crazy when did you guys go out in la it was that night yeah like a week ago yeah like a week ago and then he's like i was like how do we do it and  and then he said i just kept kind of you gotta stay on top of them like yeah when can we do it when can we do it when can we do it and then uh he's like the baby's out there right now he said he's down and we're like all right  let's do it i'm a huge and then but yeah we had to wait around a while right it was supposed to go down last night yep and then it was supposed to be like three or four and now he's saying seven or eight he's probably gonna show up at like midnight yeah yeah it's gonna be tomorrow at three or four no imagine the rappers are just like that's the thing with the pod you just gotta be on standby it makes sense like he knows we're going to be ready whenever he's ready so he's like  if you want the best guess you got to act quick  quick and you just got to be like ready you know what i mean you're in kodak's living room for five hours bro five hours yeah what the  just but chilling with his family and checking eating deep fried when you're at kodak's house you're not gonna leave until you get that episode because you're at his place you know so it's different rappers are on rapper time yeah it's true it's a real thing just like  it they're like whatever time i want to do it i'm gonna do it i want to see him live to baby he goes pretty ham at his concerts you watch him i've seen a  i heard that he's not getting booked a lot though right now in miami he's doing rolling aloud is he oh right yeah on friday is it because of the controversial  or what yeah but i think like that was like a year ago and  if we don't go to croatia we should  yeah we have to croatia for andrew so i hate andrew tate god damn it dude it's up to you you're welcome to come why do you have that reaction i uh don't go to kroy i mean i hit andrew tate and i said we gotta come out and he said i'm like what are you doing and then he's like there's this thing called yacht week oh god so you get on a yacht and you island hop for seven days i've heard of it so i hit like i posted a story and then the yacht week actually hit me hit us back so they might set us up with like a free yacht so he said he's down to do uh a pod and then i also said yo let's do an elk video because no one's like everyone's doing him over zoom but no one knows what he's like his lifestyle is like so like if we go and film a milk video yeah i think i want to know yeah i would i want to know how that if he's actually if he's capping about his lifestyle or if he's actually like that rich he claimed he claimed he's a trillionaire obviously that's not really a trillionaire yeah that's obviously he said that yeah well he trolls but like i want to see like what what is he at what's his lifestyle actually like yeah because i don't know how he  makes his money well i know he makes a  ton of money on that like whatever uh hustlers thing is the thing that he does on the internet now so what does he do what's that well how he got all these people posting about him was basically oh right he he like created this website where you could sign up to like almost use his content to generate views i don't know if it's for adsense or for whatever it's for but that's how that's why you see him everywhere because everyone's posting about him yeah so like a part of his course is like use me for content and your page will grow and your page will grow whoa bro that's what he's so clickable that it's perfect yeah i mean he made himself clickable because he says such crazy  exactly that's a huge winwin yeah it's  amazing i mean anyone could do that anyone could he no one's done it because tick tock's so interesting because the the small people go viral yeah so if you have five thousand people permission to post you like that no you don't have to get permission but you could just tell them i could do it  so he probably makes specific clips for specific pages no he's just shooting content for like that his platform and also podcasts that we're seeing or like  we're seeing on the internet that he's like doing his own podcast type  and then people are using that content and like putting clips and just because it's it's become this like snowball effect it just keeps gathering steam which is why we're  talking about it i feel like you guys will be boys probably i called him today he seems really cool yeah but if you so if you guys are watching this right now in two days we're probably flying to croatia and we're gonna yeah island hop with andrew tate for three days god damn it see what he's like i wanna see i wanna spend time with my dogs man dogs are andrew tate in croatia for three days the   that's the lamest thing i've ever heard it's your call what are you beta i can't believe this one though it's like i can't miss that one i think i think like but we're not gonna do the girl thing we're not gonna bring the girls what girls for like the you know we were talking about having a podcast with him and like oh i don't think so okay i want to watch i mean we could try i want to see that guy hit on a girl like no cameras just see what his game is like he told me three different ways on the phone to bring chicks well can you tell them or no huh three different ways kinda like no like he just said it like he's like yeah get your yacht and like bring chicks on your yacht and like then he like said it again he's like oh oh i thought he was getting because he's like pretty much saying like yo don't make sure your yacht's not dust oh i thought he was saying like do strategic dudes yeah well he doesn't want to be on maybe bring like four guys then like fill it with chicks like i was like oh  all right interesting it's expensive though how do we bring chicks to croatia can't you just find him in croatia we can that's gotta be just leave i got that i'll take oh yeah you got that yeah i'll take a lead on that you worry about other  you worry about seeing your dog on facetime i'll take care of the chicks yeah i miss my dog man  it's tough i think it would be epic though what i think it'd be epic no are we getting like an actual emergency alert it's like a flood warning tsunami's coming imagine the baby pulled the fire alarm yeah it's buying time tsunami warning bro croatia though where is that where the  is that i called that i called carnage so it's next to greece because he's always there right 16 hours in yeah it's a farass flight   i called carnage and he said he's like if you want to go to a place that doesn't even look like the  world like go there like he said it's so beautiful what does it look like it's just dope why does it matter dude why would you turn that down no i'm not dude i just what else you really got going on you got some  dude i have a lot of  going on you got to compete with andrew too like if he's working on something you got to interfere and jim bro him on his chick yeah and try and swoop he's competing on a girl yeah oh i think he might  you up though he's a kickboxer wasn't he i don't give a  search up that island that starts with a h it's like havar or some  but actually this actually sounds like a really good time check it out i look like a vagina what the hell you see that little hair on top of the trees is it just me this is i wish this was on camera right now it is amazing holy  where the  is croatia yeah pull up a map is this like a there's a lot of crow i have a lot of croatian friends in canada really bro oh it's by italy that's that makes sense mediterranean wow that actually makes so much sense so far it's extremely extremely obvious  croatia bro bro it's probably i'm gorgeous i like these spontaneous trips like that right i don't know what's gonna happen italy is so beautiful so this is this is the mediterranean it's  incredible i thought you and dan b  went there bro he does me and dan b went with ted models  oh you and damn no i'm saying you yeah we went to thailand oh okay yeah we didn't go to croatia that was fun holy  this would be crazy though i hope it goes down does he have girls out there like that or is like we got to bring the girl i don't know that's what i'm saying that's why i like dan like that he doesn't he's not gonna give us girls but i mean we could try to pick up girls but this is where we would be going really yo i think the baby shot somebody inside a walmart he shot someone recently didn't he yeah at his house this happened a long time ago walmart was like three or four years ago but there's 2000 footage yeah i saw that you should probably know that it's uh four years ago 2018 but there's new like footage of it yeah oh damn he killed it yeah he killed that guy  bro what the  yo gabe you gotta pat him down when he comes in here into security you have to do it pat down yo that's the thing can we agree that gabe needs to just like pat him down get back like you're our security which isn't a good look for us podcast he's not he's not afraid like i'm afraid yeah but he's coming to a bike and come here and  shoot us he didn't go to walmart to shoot anybody he went to get a new  led tv and he  killed a guy yeah no i don't know if that's exactly what happened i think it's a little more complicated than that but i mean he's not gonna walk in here and be like what are you looking at and trying to shoot us i mean he might not like you you have the highest odds of being shot by the baby what you're saying whatever i'll take that as long as i don't die  it shot by the just like take one shot yeah nice i feel like you're frail like if you got shot you'd die really quickly yeah yeah fast no one would do anything to help save me like no i'd help you'd  yeah my cuban it's my  no no if you died i would yeah that's okay and i give it back to  meal cause it's a  loner that you're just wearing yo yo yo good to meet you guys the two fattest chains too but i bet him i bet him 5k mine would be bigger so i lost that gabe you want to get a mic fix yeah get it y'all gambling man you need a mic on me no no we're good as long as you as big big episode all right so we got to start this off yeah the most important question yo right away french huh how much you mentioned right now cause you look like for real you're in the gym i don't even it's the thing i've been i'm like it's been like a whole month that i've been bullshitting i ain't even been back in in a whole month so really right now i look at myself right now like like i'm skinny but you taking seriously not when i do like i just got with a trainer and everything i just be needing to be motivated once i'm in the groove and i see results and ain't nothing i'm trying to become no gym for a month yeah but you take the gym serious though when i'm in there yeah especially with the trainer yeah or i wouldn't even i wouldn't even yeah what are you trying to get a client he's trying to get him he came in here like the cut off he looks like he really takes the juice right you take the gym oh i take it for real yeah yeah so that's why i'm that's what i'm gonna be at i'm saying where'd you guys hit in europe oh man a number of different places uh we started off i was in korea like two days before i flew back just to shoot a music video and then flew right back which i don't know why i did this i should just did the video when i got back but whatever um so i flew back to do a music video i flew back into la straight from korea and spent fourth of july in la in the hotel room watching the  fireworks yeah i'm saying miles away or whatever i'm like i didn't even realize it was fourth of july you know i'm saying until i saw fireworks outside of the hotel my name is fourth of july i could have went home man what videos you shooting north korea y'all go no no no i went i had a show in north korea okay i was headlining festival north korea south korea south korea yeah yeah yeah yeah imagine norway you can't go that'd be lit that'd be a lit show like north korea south korea you know i was it was so much love that oh it's crazy that they know my music i'm saying like word for word but yeah what's that like when you perform in like asia and  like yeah it's different yeah i'm saying it's surreal you know what i mean i went overseas though like my first year in the game 2019 i went overseas i went to like uk but that's closer to you know what i'm saying like american culture for sure you know i mean like and i was getting ready to go on my run like they had already like payment events and everything all right before cover you know i was like i had like number one song in the world when kobe hit so i had already it was on my i had a calendar for like the whole year ahead before the ball even dropped and i was supposed to go to all them places but that's when covey hits the world kind of shut down yeah i'm saying so they're just now getting to get me back around so they wrap them like my day one do you think people show more love overseas or in the us um like at shows and all that uh it's it's different you know what i'm saying like it's and you gotta think like so if you're talking about like a tour like it's different because everybody just pulling up they're pulling up specifically for their artists right and i'm saying which i sold out like my first three tours you know i'm saying when i pop like first one was like you know the regular capsized rooms that people started off with but they had to like upgrade me like about like my second or third date just because that's when suge was going crazy you know what i'm saying yeah so i ended up i did i completed like two arena tours in the us and that love is crazy too you know what i'm saying every single person is there for you people bringing me pictures of me and my kids pictures of me i ain't i don't even got you know what i'm saying like yeah that type of stuff you know it's different but when it's overseas and these people don't even speak the same language as you like literally like i can't even ask somebody you know what i'm saying yeah hey uh what's up the record i can't even ask the most simple question you know what i'm saying people know your music word for word yeah my music come on okay now they know i can say put your hands in the air they look at me like like what the  is he talking about you know what i'm saying that music come on like nope every word yeah i mean yeah i'm saying you blew up really fast too yeah i mean you know on a from a mainstream standpoint you know what i'm saying just look like that though no i probably just looked like that because of how like once i got an adult like uh boom you know what i'm saying 100 miles and running like i ain't slow down at all and i'm glad i did like i mean i really treated it like the same way i would treat like like anything like on the streets you know what i'm saying like it's nothing's guaranteed nothing's promising i'm saying and even later on like and this i'm saying that to say like the way covert hit i don't know where you know what i'm saying like if i wouldn't have came in 2019 most people would have had to hit something like suge and just you know what i'm saying i could have sat back and ate off that for like two years i'm literally overseas three years later that's what they want to hear you know what i'm saying like they want to hear those so i really could have just like ate off of like my very first release you know what i'm saying is the mainstream artist like the music got popped with but i dropped another album six months later i dropped kirk then i dropped uh uh blame it on baby you know what i'm saying six months after that and i dropped that right when covey hit like we had masks i had i got a mask on my face but i did all that within a year and six months of being in the game i feel like rock stars two of those albums number one albums i went number one first week you know what i'm saying what is stuff like people have been in the game five years just not doing what do you think making saturday night live jimmy i did all that like what makes you different and i'm like why are you getting that driver you know what i'm saying like i'm just me and then not only that like you know i'm in love with like the hustle you know what i'm saying no matter what it is that i do yeah so i just i don't i just really it anyone can say so about like accomplishments with me is more so like the journey in the hustle that's what i that's what i rock with did anyone teach you that specifically yeah i mean probably yeah i had to see my pops you know what i'm saying like just to never be satisfied with it it's always like what's next side job well done what's next what's next you still don't you always been set up that way i'm still that way right now but bro i feel like you went super viral during covet because rockstar and toes i remember went wild during that time too crazy so's was on the before the one that uh that rockstar was on toes was on kirk so i was still doing his thing but i was just ready to i was just always ready to just boom boom boom like i had more i had no i just had so much more to offer even like a song like rockstar like the contrast between rockstar and the song i broke through with suge you know what i'm saying that's like two completely different yeah do you know which ones are gonna go like viral and crazy yeah yeah yeah for sure for sure i really don't try to i don't try to guess it so much now just because i ain't dropped the album in two years and in three months you know the game changed so much so now i'm more so just you know back to just making music that i love making it what's changing put it out let people receive it i mean no just music the game it just changes it it evolves you know what i'm saying it's constantly evolved you know i'm saying real quick real quick you know what i mean i guess so many artists that are in the game doing their thing now it was you know it was probably like you know i meet them they'd probably be like hey bro watching you boom boom boom like that's what made me blah blah blah you know what i'm saying but like people say that to you yeah it's oh yeah are you are you like a competitive guy when it comes to like numbers and  like that with other rappers like you trying to like set records i mean i already did like when it come to all that like i already did but i ain't that ain't really what i'm on i'm definitely like yeah i definitely like straw to be the best at whatever i do you get what i'm saying but it's it ain't like a personal competitive type thing like it's all good i really already did it i already beat everybody you know what i'm saying like i did like i got like you know bt awards best new artist this award best and i was the top streaming artist in the world i got three billboard awards two or three i was a top streamer artist in the world you know what i'm saying in in uh 2020 you know like that ain't that's and so you know the way i that's why you know just like my approach on anything i do period like that's what that's why i was able to just come in and just do what i did because i really didn't even pay this  no attention and i look up and it's like boom number one about like your father and your relationship with your father yeah because you you you obviously i i know you i know that you had all of the come up everything and your father had passed and you still don't know how he passed nah i mean i ain't even not they say he had health problems and even like when we came to his crib right to them come like pack the like package stuff up and everything um because i had to take like a jet there like it was like my second day on tour you know what i'm saying like my second day on tour so i had to go there for the funeral i took a jet there just to go this is when i didn't even know what was up period you know what i'm saying i fly in i took a regular flight there it's the very next morning after i find out one in the morning it's the very next morning i get on the plane um but me and my little brother we in this crib we get access to his crib and i found out type of like medication and  like that too my brother he talked more with my brother than he talked to me i'm more like him i'm more like stubborn like i don't really want to talk to nobody so i get the job done especially him because that's what we do you know what i'm saying like we own i don't want no cookie no cupcakes no claps no nothing it's just you know yeah yeah job well i lost my father when i was six does does this like does it drive you does it make you want to be better yeah for sure i mean that's already instilled in me and not only that like the the beauty of it is he got to see me boom break through and pop right before you know what i'm saying he got the q hit me and tell me hey look you taught me something you know i mean boom so it kind of felt like you know the   was so weird to me man you know what i'm saying it kind of just felt like you know at least i got to you know show him his his job as a father was boom well done completed the right way you know what i'm saying before he left her so it was all good that's the only part about it to give me peace like he literally texted me text it to me you get what i'm saying so that's the only part about it kind of give me peace on the situation but like had i known like as far as like me not knowing that he had like health problems and  going on he was taking all that medication she had like surgery this and that like because he don't you know and i'm the same way like he didn't want to tell me no complaining yeah he probably told my little brother cause their relationship is is that but me like i'm like you know i'm like him what i'm saying well you're from we see you you're all over the ground you're a family guy for sure you're all about the family so how's it changed like being a father like i always hear people say like once you have kids it really changes you yeah um i had my firstborn daughter like when was it 2017 so it's like a year before i popped um in which i was already you know like the second i i got him from a microphone and wrapped like it was to be you know where i'm at today was to take it all the way there i would have just left it where was it like the second i would have felt like i'm not you know like people like in my city like they was competing with like each other like trying to be you know the man in the city and off the rip like i was already competing with like i had my eyes on people like drake and these people and whoever was hot as hell at the time you know what i mean like i was competing with them so that was the level like that i was hustling on you get what i'm saying were you actually competing with that circles around no i mean not and and i won't say compete but like that's i'm striving to be like them i'm trying to outdo them who are people and then those people became my peers who were people like you were like watching like that drake who else watching um like they hustled like and the way they like like they like so that's like somebody like as far as like yeah yeah like who like inspired you to like watch your future show um like the way he like once he dropped what was it a monster oh yeah he dropped was that coding crazy on there boom yeah yeah it was that it was it was probably that right there because i wouldn't do a number right around in the car making plays all day anyways that's all i was listening to you were bumping monster in your dad's mercedes right yeah coding crazy you know that song that's hard as  yeah what's wrong with that why are you hating everything on them projects so like before you got hot you were looking at these guys like this this is the competition i wanted to be with not the people in your city like as you were like off the rip the second i just stepped in front of a microphone you know yeah you're like that's where you wanted to go yeah yeah yeah like i was trying to go all the way there i wasn't trying to rap to get girls to be cool none of that  i already had that type of  going on i already had motion i'm saying so i really wasn't it was a little bit different with me like and i really wasn't too excited about that i had i had what i had going on but it wasn't really you know back then we'll go to the club i'd be in there really like with the straight face the whole night like you know that's a little bit too tough what's your vibe in the club that's right yeah that's a good what's the best thing to do in the club like wow just you know do you the best thing to do is you just you know do you and i mean different clubs got different type vibes though but now like more so like if i go to a club i go to club now i'm probably getting paid yeah and if i'm not getting paid to go then i'm going to have a good time and i just you know i have a good time if i go but i ain't really yeah what is that what does the club pay you to pull up oh man it varies it varies you know what i'm saying sometimes i you know i get 200 oh 200k but you're performing though you're doing a couple songs right i do a few yeah one like three but i always overplay it though like if you you know that's  like it's the best gig ever you over deliver you said a couple songs hell yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i'll do it because if they're giving you that type of bag that means love that i mean it's you got that type of draw in that club and then you got to come back after generally here it's people's full of people that just you know got nothing but love and they don't get to get that close to you like it was such a like it was a divide put between me and those types of fans because when i popped i went so big like i went from being like in the clubs where people like so close to me like where for like a roofing to come off this morning from being in the clubs to like getting 10 15 in the clubs to boom like hey like now you need to go on tour which i accepted less when you first go on tour i went from getting like 15 in clubs easy to get in like and then i've only got to be in the club 20 minutes yeah saying okay now you got to go home a hard ticket sale run and you got to perform for 45 minutes to an hour or i was an hour off the rip actually yeah hour and you only get 7 500 i'm like man hell no i don't know like trust me like the way you perform boom uh i trusted him i popped out i went around that corner the first show saw them damn people i'm like okay yeah remember the first big bag you got for a performance first big bag i don't remember that anything i i can't remember that i'm still stuck on 200k i know how about  amazing you should be doing this times a week for a club  before y'all gonna make me send attacker i could ask real quick and it'll probably come through before what's the most for a feature you ever got on like on a feature do a lever no what feature was it do aleppo because i saw that with the bag do a leap it's on the internet so i'm gonna say it was 350k just pretty lit i think it was three even it said 350 it might have been three who said that that's on the internet but yeah i literally said that a bunch of different articles yeah can't believe everything you see on the internet buddy i think it was 300 to be phil i think she got off cheap though no extra grease in the pan should ask for 400 it was at least three though it was three it might have been 350 that song has 14 billion streams on spotify absolutely they love it overseas let's talk about that singing the word word i was two stepping and  let's talk about the internet let's talk dude i got a question for you what do you think like now nowadays do you think the internet and like social media has a massive effect on an artist's ability to to grow to become popular to grow yeah like to to cause like i'll see random  pop off like random people like do you think if artists are not using social it's just like they're they're done for they can't they can't understand what artist doesn't use social media yeah i'm saying like i mean at some point i think it i think in the beginning yeah you do but at some point i think like it may be safer for you not to use it as much you get what i'm saying yeah i think i think why because you can become overexposed well they believe that you overexpose when really they you know it's like it's like me i got a prime example like i don't really got to speak you know what i'm saying yeah like i don't even got to speak that way like i get to where i'm so big you get what i'm saying to certain people like people see me on saturday night live like yeah i didn't even know what saturday night no disrespect to saturday night i didn't know what saturday night live was until i went you know i'm saying like i didn't know how massive it was you get what i'm saying like i didn't oh yeah i didn't know you get what i'm saying so even when i'm going like everybody's so like my team everybody's so excited so excited like even the performance that i did they're like you know what i mean like oh that like it was just so like just me doing me type of thing like you know what i mean like i was so all over the place i probably had maybe like 15 days off the whole 365 days like the first you have pop if that and those like holidays you know what i'm saying like or birthdays where i'm like nah i gotta and but even on a birthday like i'm leaving that night like i'm gonna do a show that night i'm doing two three shows a day that type of  but like i mean the only difference not like it'll leave you like like me like i get so in other people's eyes like i'm like a  household name um you know and i mean you know to the world's defense like i was like like i don't even know if i'm supposed to speak on this but whatever i don't i don't give a  like i have my own meal at burger king a lot of people don't know that it was called the jonathan kirk mill they wanted to use my name i shot a commercial for it and everything right before everything popped up yeah i got i still they had my name on the box everything no no that's when all the controversy and  wait what was it was it fire or nah yeah it was yeah what was it what was it it was the jonathan kirk mill says he's gonna come through burger king and see like my government name and i'm like why don't you use the baby and they like nah they want to use jonathan kirk was supposed to be like the real meal real ingredients that was the whole thing the real the real what was on it what was on the burger oh i told him no mayo because i don't like mayonnaise this canadian canadians love mail that's what i'm talking about no  man he's a canadian in the middle east what do you go ketchup and mustard yup ketchup tastes like a double cheeseburger he puts mail on a hot dog no i don't know hot dog all the canadians no i don't do it on a hot dog on a burger mail on it may i want a burger spike about that that's kind of weird too i don't know i'm strictly ketchup on a hot dog which is also not cool but it has bacon too i like bacon bacon burger so like i had a lot of  going on so with that going on like i don't know i mean people would see like how big i am and like the streaming numbers and if you look at the billboard top 10 like i'm on there and all that  but i'm still you know i'm still like just i'm me you know i'm saying i'm still just a downer or a person to me i'm just doing me like i'm not even really caught up in what i got going on i probably should be more caught up in it then i would be more aware that you know i got to move a certain way you know you know say watch what i say you know when i'm in certain places or whatever you give what i'm saying but to me like it's just another day on the job everything that's why people respect you so much though because it's not just like yourself you don't give a  yeah i mean at the end of the day that's what you got to do and you know whatever comes with it it comes with it you know you just gotta you gotta figure it out that's life that's life in general you know but that's why i approach any hustle i do like i'm you know i'm full of steam ahead like i don't really i don't play around with nothing because you know you never know i look at it like a drop you know what i'm saying in the streets like it's the same thing like that's guaranteed to happen you know what i'm saying it's going to make or break cussless shit's guaranteed to happen i mean yeah absolutely and whatever game you play you know what i mean ain't nothing just ups ups ups ups ups ups like that for me so i don't expect it yeah you know i don't expect it out of this business for sure so through all that because like all the i'm assuming we're talking about the same thing the drama the rolling loud yeah yeah um what did you learn through all that and have you came out and spoke about that stuff yet no i mean not this i've spoke about it several times like on the story yeah nah nah nah i'd rather not i'd rather just talk about it in the music no i mean i have hell yeah besides like on the you know the ig stores like when this  first happened like that i spoke on it several times it didn't been a whole year yeah you know what i'm saying coming up probably a year now yeah it'll be like a whole year like next week probably yeah you know what i'm saying when i'm walking down you're performing now right friday yeah that's this week i'm pissed bro because it's hard to see that you're not headlining all right but that's something i saw i love it man even like you know when the  when everything was going on rolling out i still like went out on like a tour with them and they had thanks for rolling loud you just did portugal right yeah absolutely i did i did a lot of any rolling lives that i wasn't on like over the past years because like i told you i was already booked all the way through uh 2021 like i was already booked damn near until now you get what i'm saying but like all the like the festivals and stuff that like had to pull back you know what i'm saying and you know respect what was going on or whatever like i was all it was radius clauses put in place like because i was at all these  you see like governor's ball a lot of palooza like i was on all them shits i was like headlining a lot of them like no i was like headlining them like every last one of them so it was a radius clause to where roland was in the same area within a month then i couldn't do both what was it what was that never they never shied away from his step back whatever you should be headlining though yeah we'll get through i'm going to say that yeah you don't know what was that like in the moment i know it's crazy yeah when all that  was going down like were you kind of scared like how everyone was like trying to sleep like that no i wasn't scared that was probably my problem that was probably my problem at all like you know none of you is like probably took that as like you get what i'm saying like you want to go harder yeah exactly like um you know you just kept doubling down like um you know what i'm saying like but that's just me like you know like it ain't yeah and that's me in any situation yeah you know what i'm saying like why do people try you all the time in person they don't they don't they don't because i feel like i've seen a few things on the internet like yeah i mean you see a thing or two and that's you know things go they go the way they go at the end of the day like you know but it's i think i think really like i like the negative perceptions and everything i put out in the media i think it kind of like you know the way the media the media paints me that draws a certain type of attention from people i don't think i know for a fact like people will see me and think like i'm a super aggressive person or whatever like you don't seem that way at all but please don't man i'm like and and i just laugh because it's like you know i'm i'm really like yeah you don't seem that way that's because you're as big as you are people gotta go they're not gonna be positive be negative yeah they go hard yeah i mean whatever you know but yes it's like yeah they had to and and when i look back like when i look at like history and like when i just studied the game i stayed the game before i even you know stepped foot into it i studied it that's why i'm like okay yeah i could definitely do that like i can be up there with them you know what i'm saying like i studied the game before i even took part in it but like all the people who had the type of motion that i had when i came in like you know you know you got to go through you got to go through what you go through you have uh you have a favor some people be you know they they blessed enough to you know be able to maneuver through it but when you pop like the way i pop and the way this person popped it the way this person had it unlocked the way this person how they don't lock i can say names but i don't even you know out of respect for people right and i get it you know what i'm saying what people go through because i go through it so i would i would never try to make somebody relive a moment they didn't group past you what i'm saying but sure you can probably think of a number of people you know what i'm saying like could have been like you know here they still living legends they still heroes but you know at some point like the world you know just trying to just bring them down for what's part of life it's a part of success you deal with absolutely once you go up once you go all the way up you know what i'm saying i can't wait for you to follow that's just the way you're so comfortable people want to see you winning until you're winning and then they  straight up absolutely um you got a favor and then you went through that then they oh my god i just love to see them win you know what i'm saying that's the way to go yeah people get bored of the canceled calls it's like yeah you know what i'm saying they want to cancel you for a bit and then it's not cool anymore and then they're like ah what like i'm over this right all right once they start damn he's creating this  he's cooling in this trend and you know it go the way it goes so it's the people who survive all the fish and i'm saying people who can survive do it and maneuver through it they they remain amongst this to other people you know they may say man  this  it ain't worth it i'm cool on it yeah we had uh we had tory lanez on like a while ago and he said he doesn't think it's canceled he just thinks it's like suspended now he doesn't believe in the cancel  what do you think about that i mean it's it's a it's interesting  in itself it's just it's a trend like it's it's not something to believe in like it ain't even a concrete thing you know what i'm saying it's just a trend of you know what's happening i think it's just straight up on the internet it's like negativity always rises to the top so yeah right now people like it's a jealousy thing that's where is it but it's like the love is always it's always great it's just negative the love's that negativity just louder you know what i'm saying and sometimes you're scared of love and make them people aren't gonna comment positive  too right like no one's not because you feel like you know people feel like they being you know what i mean they doing too much if they do that so it's kind of but if you look if you know how to read between the lines it's definitely it's always still there i think where people who going through it  up it and i've i've been guilty of this before you get what i'm saying is when you give more attention to the negative than the pot because like i say like i'm i'm whole live okay going through this careerwise over here and then i go overseas so i've never been they don't know nothing about they they got different trends or whatever they follow over there like they yeah oh my god they fainting you know what i'm saying south korea they don't give a  like that yo i feel like most of the negativity has got to be from americans south korea is showing love it was south korea portugal um oh man is there a i went everywhere i went i went everywhere in europe just now bro poland poland um i went to paris i went to norway right yep what's your favorite out of all those places that i just went to yeah uh portugal where the best girls at the bet which one had the best girls grease has some have some vibes did you go to croatia no i went to uh uh um kosovo uh kosovo i ain't

translators with you no no we didn't how do you communicate even in south korea no south korea we did yeah you know yes oh my god we did we definitely did south korea was love they they treated me great and if i told y'all what i just made you know what i'm saying in south korea yeah and that's one yeah in south korea international yeah i ain't tripping well how many times we need the bag go

of where they do what they be having olympic set over there oh  whatever that um whatever that arena is i think it's open what's this what's the fans like what's the vibe like what do you see when you look fans in south korea compared to like americans is it still like everybody's getting lit i see oh yeah for you know all the words they know all the words yeah yeah on my instagram what the iphone video it ain't chopped up and ain't edited none of it how are the girls in south korea is there any fire out there there's fire everywhere why are you laughing why are you laughing  this guy they're

you can rub and tug twice a week brad i don't know why you're laughing bro whatever live at the top his response was hilarious the pause was hilarious yeah nah i just you know i was trying to let it i was trying to process it absolutely that's what i love doing the most out of every out of all aspects of music yeah i love making the music but i love performing for sure that's so dope that you get paid to do what you love the most because it's not anybody can make the music like yeah  a lot of people they go in the dark room they close the door they kick everybody out turn oh there's a few baddies in there like performing you got to really be you got to really mean everything you say what kind of artist do you make of me you got everything you say do you have a ton of music made or do you make it like on the fly i you i make it on the flop you guys think it'd have been two years so like at this point like i got more music unreleased music i've ever had in my life like because usually i don't even like making it i like to feel exactly you know what i'm saying like the music when the music comes out like i don't want it to be you know what i'm saying past buildings yeah you want from the heart or i'm not gonna  with it like i'm gonna drop it in because i didn't already moved on from who i was so you have months ago a year ago should you i give me my release date all right so i got to have the assets turned in by this time this is the deadline and i go to the studio and they ask and be like okay let's clear these the ones i'm doing hey damn you know what i'm saying to send everybody in the frenzy but it's art you know what i'm saying like that's the way i paint you said that the music evolves so quick that you can't really sit on tracks yeah i ain't really want to sit on any time i have like i won't even  with it like you know what i'm saying like like i'm going forward this is the most like attention i've paid to like some music before i've dropped it before like the new project i'm getting ready to drop when does it drop album can you say yeah  that um yeah i could say it  it yeah i'm gonna drop it begin in august let's go oh yeah so we talking like full album obviously yeah for sure eat up the end of the summer can you say the name of it baby on baby too oh yeah do you like doing uh you like doing like solo tracks more are you like features because i feel like my own  yeah like on my own  uh probably solo tracks i like collaborating too you get what i'm saying i like collaborating when when the artist like when just when we both equally invested in the song you know what i'm saying other than that like it's it's all good like i ain't tripping i didn't did that before like like i think at a certain point like i was on everybody  i want to say this i remember at one point you were on everyone's  and you were like probably it was probably some of the best music absolutely i remember that time yeah it was i was on everybody's  you know what i'm saying like from i mean i was people calling me to be on this  that i've never heard of before yeah you know what i'm saying are people trying to are people are people coming back to you are they they gonna come back yeah yeah they're gonna come back but it's all like you know it's part of the game and that's why i ain't tripping like it was up it i treated like business like i don't really you know that's just how i treat it anyways like i ain't really know you know like we don't got to be i get it i let some of these people i ain't never met bruh like i've never seen you say to them though say like who are you or you just go for a big bag i don't say  i mean they come they send the song to me ask me oh okay yeah even if you've never heard of them you'll you'll listen to it and see i'm gonna listen to it you know what i'm saying i mean i haven't been some before why just you know what i mean it was something before i didn't want to do i still did yeah and they ended up being yeah i'm you have any big features on this album on this app for sure mmhmm i do and the ones i got on this album all yeah like they they like they them type of features like i really don't even care to do features like if i got a feature on this album like it's somebody who i really like you know what i'm saying like okay yeah i want to hear them on this song like it's you know yeah tony you're gonna i'm sorry when are you gonna reveal a track list um i really ain't i ain't probably like the week before like i really don't even trip on like trackless type  like you know what i'm saying i don't know how do you know like i'm ready to just bomb like this yeah how do you know when you want someone on the song like how do you know that i mean i don't know like i and this like just the way i work like when it's my music like i would stop like at the first like i thought i'd do the first verse i just wouldn't even i'd be like okay open it up and bounce it out like a lot of songs i just know like i you know i see the entire song being done before i even finished if the person i got in mind boom ended up passing on it because this and i'm the same way like it's a bunch of songs i love the songs people just hit me but like i just got to be in the vibe of making music to really make it if i meant about boom i you know once i go to once i do do it though it's it's nothing like it's nothing i make a song sitting right here in front of y'all sitting on the couch just like this that's a lot of  i made a lot of songs on top i made bop in the hotel room in miami damn that's what i was yeah dance went wild too yeah i made that  you don't write a lot it's more just oh just go for it you don't write at all no no no way no i'll write it up what i don't play the music are you for real yeah oh my god that's cool so how many tape how many times you got to go through it though i mean i i punch in you know what i'm saying on something some of my some some of them i just walk  down some of them punch in you know i go in and out do you uh do you have a favorite artist you like to work with anybody favorite artist that i like to work with um i don't know i wouldn't even say i don't wear anything see the thing with me like a lot of people like a lot of and this is another thing like so with features not like i would rather like be in the room with the artist you get what i'm saying like yeah they do that exactly or they be in the room with me even if i already did my part or something whatever and i ain't no no like i'm not really with the like like you don't gotta hang with me to make music with me like i ain't really that type of guy like it's all good when it comes to that type of  but like you know i'm just like on a on an artistic level you know what i'm saying because we could do so much more you know what i mean but like a lot of people like yeah what do you mean you want to record you could do so much more like it's like you can hear something and i can add something to it we can just you can make it so much more better you know it's just so much more you could do if you in the same room it's like what you guys can do sitting in the room as opposed to us all being on a  zoom call i guess i meant what do you mean they don't need to hang with you what does that mean oh yeah like we don't gotta you know we don't gotta really fake kick it some people you do it depends on what level you want to create on but like me like you know if this is like for me to want somebody on my song i gotta already be a fan of their work you get what i'm saying so we don't gotta really you know has anybody ever like sent you some  sent you some  and you're like oh you might want to run that back or you didn't really feel it and you hit him straight and you're like yo bro like maybe one more take oh like sent me a verse and i ain't  with it yeah yeah for sure and you tell them you're straight up like i'll run it back well everything about him i'm gonna tell nobody to run back like i ain't never told nobody to like redo that verse before i do that i just probably just won't use it oh okay yeah cause what you did is what you did you know yeah did people catch feelings like that oh yeah no like if they send you a voice then it's like yo why don't you want to like give me a feature yeah yeah it doesn't come out yeah they're getting their what do you think about him trying to be president i think i'm voting yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i'm voting yeah for sure i'm full yeah yeah he's a gangster but he's never going to

saying yeah and then once they start seeing me like do more in the community they see me do like i don't know i don't know which i know it just changed out of nowhere i think probably like they see me i came and spoke at like um some type of like panel that was incident like the the city council was there everybody was there a lot of people it was that once i came and did that like now they you know they embrace me with open arms they're like they let me move like a human being you know what i'm saying so now it's all low you like to stay away from like like you would did you ever live in la or anything like that nah i was about i was about to get me a spot out in la right before cover here because i was just out there so much like with me and then with what i want to do like on like a film and you know film production site like that's why the resources is it but like even with like music videos like i was i was getting so much work done on that level you know what i'm saying out in la i was going to get a spot out there every time i went to la i'm working working working on stopping la new york like them two spots i'll go there i boom you can't take me nowhere yeah you can't take me i wouldn't say most product most productive yeah like music video yeah you can't take me nowhere with that amount of resources you know yeah so you like to get away and just go back here to the candy store oh you like to just get away and go back i wouldn't get away from everything no i don't i don't call it a getaway that's when i go to everything that's when i go yeah get to work but it's north carolina getting older yeah yeah yeah so i'll be cooling i'll be cooling i'd be riding around like i was and in 2014 chillin has mj ever showed you love at the hornets game car still um at pump number four rolling up before i pull off michael jordan sure do you love i yeah yeah yeah yeah we did see uh mj walking out there one time he was sitting in his lamp truck he showed me love he's showing up my first time bumping into him down uh damn what's the crib the crib is the crib is nice like a fortress or what before that's what they'd be saying in the media yeah fortress with guys with damn man media but i like i like the description of the crib though they said it's like they said it's like tony montana's house there they go in the media like there's guards walking around with ars i don't know that's what they say bro they say you're walking out with a gun everywhere that's what they're saying straight up what they do yeah i live i live in north carolina by the way i live in north carolina you know that's amazing i'm sorry all right yeah you can you can have a you know you have to um yeah everybody has one people got them they kids got them you know what i'm saying like kids like in the country like you know well i'm from charlotte it ain't as country as like other outside areas but like yeah they teach they take their kids to the gun range and  so you know people who a lot of people who and it's different you know some people from new york where you can't have them la they super strict on them but i think a lot of people who are um who are what you would call like maybe over opinionated like on on like gun yeah gun control is that they just lack the knowledge like they don't know you can rightfully possess a firearm just like everybody else you know i'm saying what do you think and they need to exercise those rights i think that'll help protect people from a lot of the  to be going on like mass shootings and  like that  is like there should be no way like that type of  can happen like that could never happen around me like never like it's gonna be some movie  like some denzel watching the grocery stores yeah yeah would you ever would you ever do acting yeah be in a movie yeah for sure i'm just they coming if you if you had to have one guy play you in a movie who would it be play me yeah me yeah but it couldn't be you but it couldn't be me yeah i don't know man the way you go with like like acting and movies and  bro you know a new a new talent would come through and just surprise you with so many people i know of now yeah through certain shows like 50 cent he's real good at like picking out talent and you know making people's stars you got um excuse me oh that's my guy named dan uh damn some idris from oh i hope i ain't  my boy name up from snowfall like people like that like just you know really all some people need is the shot and the right script and the right yeah you know what i'm saying the right story you know what i'm saying and then they can just boom you know i feel like i can put any good actor in you know in the script this just fueled by my ideas and yeah what was your childhood like switching the subject a little bit um that's broad for me yeah you grew up like how did you grow up like in what what sort of uh environment financial setting like how were you different ones um different ones definitely definitely came from nothing at all you know what i'm saying it was me my mama my two brothers you know what i'm saying so um uh uh we i know when when my mama got like the first crib that she got we thought it was a  mansion we was calling it a mansion you know i'm saying it what number like a three bedroom house upstairs and i said to us that was a match now it's like yeah okay you know whatever but like up until then like you know it started off with apartments apartments whatever we was born and me and my me and my brother sitting right here we was born in cleveland ohio we moved to charlotte when we was when i was seven yeah when i was six seven six just turned seven you know what i'm saying i'm 30 now right so i've been in charlotte like you know i'm basically from charlotte you know but i learned i've seen a whole lot of  before the age of seven two so it's so many different sides in me so from mississippi to cleveland to charlotte them three places clarksdale mississippi cleveland ohio charlotte north carolina anybody could do like their research on all three and you know or google maps to  and zoom in and yeah see what it looked like and then yeah i let that paint the picture yeah but because to me like you know and this is like this is  like i had to start doing like interview i mean i know i came from that you know what i'm saying like i understand this but like it wasn't until i got popped and started doing interviews and i get asked that question more and more and i go into detail about it that's what makes me think about it because up until then it's just this is normal to us like you know it's just how we think it's supposed to go how old were you when you first got in the studio um i used to like i uh i remember somebody having one like up the street from me maybe like two neighborhoods up and um i go up there and rap with them but   would be like funny style though i remember like the one or two times i would like go rap like at like a studio and  like that like i was little like to whoever did have access to computer and software and all that  you know what i'm saying like dad get my ass up out of there like i do some  with them and i was better for sure so how did everybody like when did you first know that your  was fire like what were you like yo this is amazing like people got made so like the first real song i made the first real but then obviously later on see i went and got like a ma i went and got a macbook and a  microphone but i just never really did and i and a camera shot the whole music video everything like did the whole  and i knew that was better than a lot of this you directed it and all that yourself i mean we talking like just a sony bro like just you just turn that  on in the apartment you get what i'm saying yeah like that type of vibe but i'm even at like the first time i really went in the studio and made a song like it was like a hit song like in my city that was a hit song like locally for me that was his i ended up getting busy on the same song like a year or two later i remixed it and then from there just but the very first song i made very first song i ever made like was yeah like i moved on to get it made i got it played in the clubs people in the clubs in my city revenue word for word like the very first time i met damn when the south by southwest wooded people going crazy chanting it i went to south by southwest like two months after rapping seriously rapping yeah did you have to do like the old school style like taking it to clubs and being like yo play this  or listen that's definitely what i did that's why you know that's like right when y'all act like i feel like i pop quit like i really like that's the hustle yeah i was like passing out cds like putting flyers on every car outside the club a flyer on every single car outside the club at all my social media whatever like two three years okay so you're dead you hustle daddy yeah of a show i did that all over the place i was doing this  down here i was in miami we was down on um we was on south beach we was on collins doing that  when i was riding around um i came out here to like shoot a video it's a song called light show um and i shot it with real ghosts with the same guys that i popped and shot shook with rockstar all that  pop um i actually went to jail shooting that video down here yeah me and like overwhelm other people wait like shooting a video oh my god they came in like press this like what y'all doing cut us off like that and they start putting people in cuz we like what you mean what's going on they start slamming slamming  putting  in handcuffs ended up charging like five of us they charged me with assault on officer it's like 2017 16 so what would you say like an upcoming artist like what do you think is the most important thing to to do in the game right now to be like a top artist to try to become a top artist right now yeah like what if someone's like besides have fire music obviously yeah yeah i would just say to just be themselves and just do them don't try to really you know i don't know because like i say it's different like so i knew how to become number one like when i you know it's it's even yeah it's more watered down now than it than it just wasn't  hungry when i popped for sure you can't  gotta walk on eggshells now you gotta be careful like yeah yeah i'm saying but with me but i don't even think you gotta do that if you're a fresh artist like what they want is that fresh you know they want that artist to give them that don't give a  feeling when they listen to them you know what i'm saying like i feel like that's what i was i feel like a lot of people pop too and then they fall off though too yeah right that's what i'm saying so it's kind of like you know it ain't really no way to it ain't no way to gauge it like you know the only advice i get somebody is just do them just stay true to you and you know and definitely stay consistent you know you're saying like in and for sure like once you get in the door like you know take full and take full advantage of it like don't like me like i ain't take a  day off like i literally did and i'm glad i did i got all my flowers before you get what i'm saying before the powers they be you know play it however they played it like i got  i got flat everything i i've ever dropped is platinum so every album i've ever dropped it's a platinum album double platinum so you put the zap everything i've ever dropped nah because you want to plant them every time right there's no pressure it comes naturally then yeah yeah it's no pressure it's even less i didn't already did it i got my rings it's like a basketball played it already yeah i'm chilling i'll let y'all i'll let y'all  grow gray hairs and  is there anything you would have done differently if you could redo it no hell no absolutely not yeah absolutely not absolutely not are you able to tell us about that story about recently when someone broke into your house yeah they ain't breaking my house they jumped the fence they broke into the the state you know what i'm saying why i i wanted a picture huh huh they wanted a picture no hell no no they're one of the cubans i'm  around dude hey  they had a hoodie on and was like nailed down behind a wall and some more  like yeah how did you like like what were you doing i was actually in the studio like uh putting together like the track list for the album and  and then how did you notice i got a call from from somebody that was outside like working like working outside like my contractor i got a call from my smack outside my house on the football field boom was just the way you talking i come outside and i'm saying yeah yeah the threat was neutralizing too you hate being in the situations like that yeah absolutely  yeah what what goes through your head when you're in a situation like this i mean what you know once once the situation was under control enough you get what i'm saying like for me to even be able to prosecute that first it's like i don't know what's going on like yeah i wouldn't you know i wouldn't expect nobody to jump a fence at my house you know what i'm saying it's clearly posted all over the place there's illinois absolutely yeah you know what i'm saying like i'm still all the way until they get there get this dude up and i walk my property in you know what i'm saying see what's up see where it came in there you know when we get everything figured out it's still to me to me it's still you know i i still can't trust like what's going on in it what's going on with that situation you still don't know why exactly they were there yeah you get what i'm saying so you know but you know the guy the guy made it out good he's okay yeah was he armed no yeah he wasn't but it's crazy like now it's like the  that happens to these people like like what happened to  pop smoke got  black that's what i'm saying yeah you know you got to be like you have to protect yourself not for sure if you're better you better especially me like i mean i got daughters you know what i'm saying you fought the posters i have had one of them have been there it probably would have went a different way i probably would have been even more like you know what i'm saying yeah definitely i would have been way more like protect them like you know what i'm saying which is me like contrary like you know popular belief like i'm i'm way more controlled and in like high pressure situations than people think i am you get what i'm saying yeah like i said just the media and the way they paint things didn't make an ant look like a dinosaur look at me like but that you know i'm i'm glad you know that situation was able to turn out the way it turned out thing yeah how how did you this kind of switching up topics but how did you and nba go about like doing that whole collab album we had to we had to pass it back and forth you know what i'm saying because just the conditions of his um it's like a whole process doing that pro it was like his probation or whatever supervisor at least whatever they got going on with him yeah it was a process for show but he got a dope ass engineer over there with him shut out the uh the jason dobas engineer did he even brought like major shots to him like he yeah he reached out to me um

big little chunk of time you guys link and then like in the same city and just like kind of yeah yeah do the whole album where he was at at the time he was located at the time it was like a dope a big dope uh like uh what you call it like one of those places where you would ski and  like a ski resort that's all like maybe like 30 minutes from him oh  that was something different to like i didn't
